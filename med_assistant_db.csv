Stern_FM.indd   8 11/07/19   4:28 pmixPreface
Our goal in creating Symptom to Diagnosis was to develop an 
interesting, practical, and informative approach to teaching the 
diagnostic process in internal medicine."
59,"Interesting, because real 
patient cases are integrated within each chapter, complementing 
what can otherwise be dry and soporific."
60,"Informative, because 
Symptom to Diagnosis  articulates the most difficult process in 
becoming a physician: making an accurate diagnosis."
61,"Many other 
textbooks describe diseases  but fail to characterize the process that 
leads from patient presentation to diagnosis."
62,"Although students 
can, and often do, learn this process through intuition and 
experience without direct instruction, we believe that diagnostic 
reasoning is a difficult task that can be deciphered and made 
easier for students."
63,"Furthermore, in many books the description 
of the disease is oversimplified, and the available evidence on the 
predictive value of symptoms, signs, and diagnostic test results is 
not included."
64,"Teaching based on the classic presentation often fails 
to help less experienced physicians recognize the common, but 
non-classical presentation."
65,"This oversight, combined with a lack 
of knowledge of test characteristics, often leads to prematurely 
dismissing diagnoses."
66,"Symptom to Diagnosis aims to help students and residents learn 
internal medicine and focuses on the challenging task of diagnosis."
67,"Using the framework and terminology presented in Chapter 1, 
each chapter addresses one common complaint, such as chest 
pain."
68,"The chapter begins with a case and an explanation of a 
way to frame, or organize, the differential diagnosis."
69,"Diagnostic 
algorithms are presented that give the learner a way of working 
through the diagnostic process."
70,"As the case progresses, clinical 
reasoning is clearly articulated."
71,"The differential diagnosis for that 
particular case is summarized in tables that delineate the clinical 
clues and important tests for the leading diagnostic hypothesis 
and important alternative diagnostic hypotheses."
72,"As the chapter 
progresses, the pertinent diseases are reviewed."
73,"Just as in real 
life, the case unfolds in a stepwise fashion as tests are performed 
and diagnoses are confirmed or refuted."
74,"Readers are continually 
engaged by a series of questions that direct the evaluation."
75,Symptom to Diagnosis can be used in three ways.
76,"First, it is 
designed to be read in its entirety to guide the reader through 
a third-year medicine clerkship."
77,"We used the Core Medicine 
Clerkship Curriculum Guide of the Society of General Internal 
Medicine/Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine to select the 
symptoms and diseases we included, and we are confident that the 
text does an excellent job teaching the basics of internal medicine."
78,"Second, it is perfect for learning about a particular problem by 
studying an individual chapter."
79,"Focusing on one chapter will 
provide the reader with a comprehensive approach to the problem 
being addressed: a framework for the differential diagnosis, an opportunity to work through several interesting cases, and a review 
of pertinent diseases."
80,"Third, Symptom to Diagnosis is well suited to 
reviewing specific diseases through the use of the index to identify 
information on a particular disorder of immediate interest."
81,"Our approach to the discussion of a particular disease is different 
than most other texts."
82,"Not only is the information bulleted to make 
it concise and readable, but the discussion of each disease is divided 
into 4 sections."
83,"The T extbook Presentation, which serves as a concise 
statement of the common, or classic, presentation of that particular 
disease, is the first part."
84,"The next section, Disease Highlights,  
reviews the most pertinent epidemiologic and pathophysiologic 
information."
85,"The third part, Evidence-Based Diagnosis, reviews the 
accuracy  of the history, physical exam, laboratory and radiologic 
tests for that specific disease."
86,"Whenever possible, we have listed the 
sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios for these findings 
and test results."
87,"This section allows us to point out the findings 
that help to “rule in” or “rule out” the various diseases."
88,"History 
and physical exam findings so highly specific that they point 
directly to a particular diagnosis are indicated with the following 
“fingerprint” icon:
FP = fingerprint 
We also often suggest a test of choice."
89,"It is this part of the book 
in particular that separates this text from many others."
90,"In the final 
section, Treatment, we review the basics of therapy for the disease 
being considered."
91,"Recognizing that treatment evolves at a rapid 
pace, we have chosen to limit our discussion to the fundamentals of 
therapy rather than details that would become quickly out of date."
92,"The fourth edition has been completely updated through a 
comprehensive review of the relevant literature and many chapters 
have undergone substantial revisions by new authors."
93,"Changes 
include new algorithms and approaches in the chapters on 
Chest  Pain, Syncope, Dizziness, and others."
94,"Recently developed 
new diagnostic tools are discussed in the chapters of Diarrhea, 
Jaundice, and Cough and Fever, and new guidelines have been 
included in the chapters on Screening, Diabetes, and Hypertension."
95,"For generations the approach to diagnosis has been learned 
through apprenticeship and intuition."
96,"Diseases have been described 
in detail, but the approach to diagnosis has not been formalized."
97,"In 
Symptom to Diagnosis  we feel we have succeeded in articulating this 
science and art and, at the same time, made the text interesting to 
read."

THE DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS
Constructing a differential diagnosis, choosing diagnostic tests, and 
interpreting the results are key skills for all physicians."
131,"The diagnos -
tic process, often called clinical reasoning, is complex, and errors 
in reasoning are thought to account for 17% of all adverse events."
132,"Diagnostic errors can occur due to faulty knowledge, faulty data 
gathering, and faulty information processing."
133,"While this chapter 
focuses on the reasoning process, remember that the data you acquire 
during the history taking and the physical exam, sometimes accom -
panied by preliminary laboratory tests, form the basis for your initial 
clinical impression."
134,"Even with flawless reasoning, your final diagno -
sis will be wrong if you do not start with accurate data."
135,"You must 
have well developed interviewing and physical examination skills."
136,"Clinicians generally use dual reasoning processes to work 
through a case."
137,"System 1 reasoning, relatively rapid and intuitive, 
is based on pattern recognition and involves matching the patient’s 
presentation to an illness script, a prior example stored in mem -
ory."
138,"System 2 reasoning is a slower process in which the clinician 
uses an explicit analytic approach."
139,"System 1 thinking predominates 
when an experienced clinician encounters a straightforward case, 
with system 2 predominating when the case is more complicated or 
the clinician is less experienced."
140,"Most of the time there is an uncon -
scious blending of the two systems."
141,"Clinicians should be aware of 
common biases in clinical reasoning (Table 1-1) and reflect upon 
their reasoning processes, looking for potential errors."
142,"This chapter 
breaks down the reasoning process into a series of steps that can help 
you work through large differential diagnoses, avoid biases, and ret -
rospectively identify sources of error when your diagnosis is wrong."
143,"A MODEL FOR CLINICAL REASONING (Figure 1-1)
Step 1: Identify the Problem
Be certain you understand what the patient is telling you."
144,"Some -
times “I’m tired” means “I become short of breath when I walk” and at other times means “My muscles are weak.” Construct a 
complete problem list consisting of the chief complaint, other 
acute symptoms and physical exam abnormalities, laboratory test 
abnormalities, chronic active problems (such as diabetes or hyper -
tension), and important past problems (such as history of bowel 
obstruction or cancer)."
145,"Problems that are likely to be related, such 
as shortness of breath and chest pain, should be grouped together."
146,"It is necessary to accurately identify the problem every time you 
evaluate a patient."
147,"Step 2: Frame the Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis should be framed in a way that 
facilitates recall."
148,"It might be possible to memorize long lists of 
causes, or differential diagnoses, for various problems."
149,"However, 
doing so would not necessarily lead to a useful organization 
of differentials that helps you remember or use them."
150,"Instead, 
it is preferable to use some kind of problem-specific framework  
to organize differentials into subcategories that are easier to 
remember and often clinically useful."
151,"Problem-specific frame -
works can be anatomic,  a framework often used for chest pain; 
organ/system,  used for symptoms with very broad differentials 
like fatigue; physiologic;  or based on pivotal points  (defined 
below)."
152,"Each chapter in Symptom to Diagnosis  begins with a 
problem-specific framework for the differential."
153,"Using such 
frameworks has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy 
of medical students."
154,"Step 3: Organize the Differential Diagnosis
Structuring the differential diagnosis into clinically useful 
subgroups  can enable you to systematically work through the 
differential diagnosis."
155,"Sometimes the framework that is easiest 
to remember, such as grouping causes of dyspnea as cardiac or 
pulmonary, does not facilitate reasoning."
156,"Then, reorganizing the 
differential in a way that helps you understand the order in which 
to consider various diagnoses is necessary."
157,"The most clinically use -
ful differentials are organized using pivotal points, one of a pair of 
opposing descriptors that compare and contrast clinical character -
istics."
158,"Examples include old versus new headache, unilateral versus 
bilateral edema, and right lower quadrant pain versus epigastric 
pain."
159,"When pivotal points are used to frame the differential in the 
first place, it is not necessary to reorganize the differential to create 
a diagnostic algorithm."
160,"You can frame and reorganize the differential yourself or find a 
source that does so in a way that makes sense to you."
161,"Each chapter 
in Symptom to Diagnosis  contains a diagnostic algorithm that uses 
pivotal points to highlight logical reasoning pathways for each 
symptom."
162,"Steps 2 and 3 need to be done only once for each clinical 
problem you encounter; with experience, you will develop a rep -
ertoire of logically framed differentials and structured diagnostic 
approaches to problems you encounter.Table 1-1."
163,Common biases in clinical reasoning.
164,"Name of Bias Description
Availability Considering easily remembered diagnoses 
more likely irrespective of prevalence
Base rate neglect Pursuing “zebras”
Representativeness Ignoring atypical features that are 
inconsistent with the favored diagnosis
Confirmation bias Seeking data to confirm, rather than refute 
the initial hypothesis
Premature closure Stopping the diagnostic process too soonI have a patient with a problem."
165,"How do I figure out 
the possible causes?"
166,"Diane Altkorn, MD

Since every disease in a differential may not be relevant to an indi -

differential diagnosis can help narrow the list."
172,"Extracting pivotal 
points from the history and physical exam enables the clinician 
to limit a large, complete differential diagnosis to a more focused 
set of diagnoses pertinent to that particular patient."

178,"Does the patient’s description of the symptom suggest a 
likely cause?"
179,What have you observed on physical exam?
180,"Focus on 
the positive—positive findings on history or physical exam are impor -
tant (65% of positive findings have a specificity > 80% and 43% 
of positive findings have a specificity > 90%)."
181,"One-third have an 
LR+ > 5, and 16% have an LR+ > 10."
182,"Some very specific findings 
strongly suggest a specific diagnosis because they are rarely seen 
in patients without the disease, just as fingerprints point to a spe -
cific person because they are not seen in more than 1 individual."
183,"Such “fingerprint” findings will be marked with the symbol “FP” 
throughout the book."
184,"On the other hand, do not be fooled by the 
negative; “classic” findings, especially individual findings, are often 
absent."
185,"Only 21% of negative findings have a sensitivity > 80%, 
and only 11% of > 90%; just 7% have an LR– of < 0.1."
186,"Step 6: Rank the Differential Diagnosis
Rank the differential diagnosis using the results obtained in Step 5."
187,"Even in a limited differential, not all diagnoses are equally likely 
or equally important."
188,"There are 4 approaches to ranking, or prior -
itizing, the differential diagnosis for a given problem: possibilistic, 
probabilistic, prognostic, and pragmatic."
189,"A. Possibilistic approach:  Consider all known causes equally 
likely and simultaneously test for all of them."
190,"This is not a 
useful approach."
191,"B. Probabilistic approach:  Consider first those disorders that are 
more likely; that is, those with the highest pretest probability,  
the probability that a disease is present before further testing 
is done."
192,C. Prognostic approach:  Consider the most serious diagnoses first.
193,"D. Pragmatic approach:  Consider the diagnoses most responsive 
to treatment first."
194,"Clearly, there are limitations to each of these individual 
approaches."
195,"Experienced clinicians simultaneously integrate prob -
abilistic, prognostic, and pragmatic approaches when reorganizing 
and prioritizing a differential diagnosis in order to decide when 
testing is necessary and which test to order (Table 1-2)."
196,"Clinicians 
use their knowledge of pivotal points; “fingerprints”; risk factors; 
typical or “textbook” presentations of disease; the variability of dis -
ease presentation; and prevalence and prognosis to select a leading 
hypothesis, must not miss hypotheses, and other active alternative 
hypotheses."
197,"Step 7: Test Y our Hypotheses
Sometimes you are certain about the diagnosis based on the initial 
data and proceed to treatment."
198,"Most of the time, however, you 
require additional data to confirm your diagnostic hypotheses; in 
other words, you need to order diagnostic tests."
199,"Whenever you do 
so, you should understand how much the test will change the prob -
ability the patient has the disease in question."
200,"Step 8: Re-rank the Differential 
Based on New Data
Remember, ruling out a disease is usually not enough; you must 
also determine the cause of the patient’s symptom."
201,"For example, 
you may have eliminated myocardial infarction (MI) as a cause 
of chest pain, but you still need to determine whether the pain is 
due to gastroesophageal reflux, muscle strain, aortic dissection, etc."
202,"Whenever you have not made a diagnosis, or when you encounter 
data that conflict with your original hypotheses, go back to the 
complete differential diagnosis and reprioritize it, taking the new 
data into consideration."
203,"Failure to reconsider the possibilities is 
called premature closure (see Table 1-1), one of the most common 
diagnostic errors made by clinicians.Step 9: Test the New Hypotheses
Repeat the process until a diagnosis is reached."
204,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Step 1: Identify the Problem
PATIENT  1
Mrs. S is a 58-year-old woman who comes to an urgent 
care clinic complaining of painful swelling of her left calf that 
has lasted for 2 days."
205,"She feels slightly feverish but has no 
other symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or 
abdominal pain."
206,"She has been completely healthy except for 
hypertension, osteoarthritis of her knees, and a cholecys -
tectomy, with no history of other medical problems, surger -
ies, or fractures."
207,Her only medication is hydrochlorothiazide.
208,She had a normal pelvic exam and P ap smear 1 month ago.
209,"Physical exam shows that the circumference of her left calf 
is 3.5 cm greater than her right calf, and there is 1+ pitting 
edema."
210,"The left calf is uniformly red and very tender, and 
there is slight tenderness along the popliteal vein and medial 
left thigh."
211,There is a healing cut on her left foot.
212,"Her temper -
ature is 37.7°C."
213,The rest of her exam is normal.
214,What is Mrs. S’s problem list?
215,"Problem lists should begin with the acute problems, followed 
by chronic active problems, ending with inactive problems."
216,"Mrs. S’s problems are (1) painful left leg edema with erythema, 
Stern_ch01_p001-p008.indd   3 11/07/19   4:29 pm4 / CHAPTER 1
(2) hypertension, (3) osteoarthritis of the knees, and (4) status post 
cholecystectomy."
217,"Step 2: Frame the Differential Diagnosis 
How do you frame the differential diagnosis 
for edema?"
218,"As discussed in Chapter 17, Edema, the problem-specific organiza -
tion of the full differential diagnosis starts with the distribution of 
the edema: generalized versus unilateral and limb versus localized."
219,"The causes of edema are fairly distinct for each of these subcate -
gories."
220,"For instance, heart failure and chronic kidney disease cause 
generalized not unilateral edema."
221,"Step 3: Organize the Differential Diagnosis
Since the edema differential is framed using the pivotal point of 
edema distribution, it is not necessary to organize it—step 3 has 
already been done."
222,"Step 4: Limit the Differential Diagnosis 
What are the pivotal points in Mrs. S’s presenta­
tion?"
223,How would you limit the differential?
224,"Mrs. S has acute unilateral leg  edema, a pivotal point that leads to 
a limited portion of the edema differential."
225,"Diagnostic possibilities are now narrowed to a distinct subset of 
diseases that can be organized using an anatomic framework:
A."
226,"Skin: Stasis dermatitis
B."
227,"Soft tissue: Cellulitis
C. Calf veins: Distal deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
D. Knee: Ruptured Baker cyst
E. Thigh veins: Proximal DVT
F. Pelvis: Mass causing lymphatic obstruction
Step 5: Use History and Physical Exam 
Findings to Explore Possible Diagnoses
Consider the risk factors for each of the diagnostic possibilities as 
well as their associated symptoms and signs."
228,"For example, venous 
insufficiency is a risk factor for stasis dermatitis, and there may 
be hemosiderin staining along the malleolar surface on physical 
exam."
229,"Cellulitis often follows skin injury, and physical exam shows 
erythema and tenderness."
230,"DVT is more frequent in patients with 
underlying malignancy or recent immobilization, and there may be 
shortness of breath if the clot has embolized."
231,"Step 6: Rank the Differential Diagnosis 
What are the important clinical clues in Mrs. S’s 
presentation?"
232,"How would you rank and prioritize 
the limited differential?"
233,"What is your leading 
hypothesis?"
234,What are your active alternatives?
235,"Mrs. S has a constellation of symptoms and signs supporting the 
diagnosis of cellulitis as the leading hypothesis: fever; an entry 
site for infection on her foot; and a red, tender, swollen leg."
236,"Even without risk factors for DVT, the active alternatives are prox -
imal and calf DVT, being both common and “must not miss” diag -
noses."
237,"If cellulitis and DVT are not present, ruptured Baker cyst 
and a pelvic mass should be considered."
238,"Finally, stasis dermatitis 
is excluded in a patient without a history of chronic leg swelling."
239,How certain are you that Mrs. S has cellulitis?
240,Should you treat her with antibiotics?
241,"How 
certain are you that she does not have DVT?"
242,Should you test for DVT?
243,"THE ROLE OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING
Step 7: Test Y our Hypotheses 
I have a leading hypothesis and an active 
alternative—how do I know if I need to do 
a test or if I should start treatment?"
244,"Once you have generated a leading hypothesis, with or without 
active alternatives, you need to decide whether you need further 
information before proceeding to treatment or before exclud -
ing other diagnoses."
245,"One way to think about this is in terms of 
certainty: how certain are you that your hypothesis is correct, and 
how much more certain do you need to be before starting treat -
ment?"
246,"Another way to think about this is in terms of probability:  
is your pretest probability  of disease high enough or low enough 
that you do not need any further information from a test?"
247,"Determine the Pretest Probability
There are several ways to determine the pretest probability of your 
leading hypothesis and most important (often most serious) active 
alternatives: use a validated clinical decision rule (CDR), use prev -
alence data regarding the causes/etiologies of a symptom, and use 
your overall clinical impression."
248,A.
249,"Use a validated CDR
1."
250,"Investigators construct a list of potential predictors of a 
disease, and then examine a group of patients to determine 
whether the predictors and the disease are present."
251,"a. Logistic regression is then used to determine which 
predictors are most powerful and which can be omitted."
252,b.
253,"The model is then validated by applying it in other 
patient populations."
254,"c. To simplify use, the clinical predictors in the model are 
often assigned point values, and different point totals 
correspond to different pretest probabilities."
255,2.
256,"CDRs are infrequently available but are the most precise 
way of estimating pretest probability."
257,3.
258,"If you can find a validated CDR, you can come up with an 
exact number (or a small range of numbers) for your pretest 
probability."
259,B.
260,Use information about the prevalence of etiologies for a symptom.
261,1.
262,"You can sometimes find this information in textbooks or 
review articles."
263,2.
264,"It is important to assess the quality of any studies you find 
before using the data."
265,C. Use your overall clinical impression.
266,1.
267,"This is a combination of what you know about disease 
prevalence and the match between the expected history

and physical with that of the patient, mixed with your 
clinical experience, and the ever elusive attribute “clinical 
judgment.”
2."
268,"This is just as imprecise as it sounds, and it has been shown 
that physicians are disproportionately influenced by their 
most recent clinical experience."
269,3.
270,"Nevertheless, it has also been shown that the overall 
clinical impression of experienced  clinicians has significant 
predictive value."
271,4.
272,"Clinicians generally categorize pretest probability as low, 
moderate, or high."
273,"This rather vague categorization is 
still helpful."
274,"Do not get distracted thinking a number is 
necessary."
275,"Consider the Potential Harms
Consider the potential harms of both a missed diagnosis and 
the treatment."
276,A.
277,"It is very harmful to miss certain diagnoses, such as MI or 
pulmonary embolism, while it is not so harmful to miss 
others, such as mild carpal tunnel syndrome."
278,"You need to 
be very certain that life-threatening diseases are not present 
(that is, have a very low pretest probability), before excluding 
them without testing."
279,B.
280,"Some treatments, such as thrombolytics, are more harmful 
than others, such as oral antibiotics; you need to be very 
certain that potentially harmful treatments are needed 
(that is, the pretest probability is very high) before prescribing 
them without testing.THE THRESHOLD MODEL: CONCEPTUALIZING 
PROBABILITIES
The ends of the bar in the threshold model represent 0% and 
100% pretest probability."
281,"The treatment threshold  is the prob -
ability above which the diagnosis is so likely you would treat the 
patient without further testing."
282,"The test threshold  is the probabil -
ity below which the diagnosis is so unlikely it is excluded without 
further testing (Figure 1-2)."
283,"For example, consider Ms. A, a 19-year-old woman, who com -
plains of 30 seconds of sharp right-sided chest pain after lifting a 
heavy box."
284,"The pretest probability of cardiac ischemia is so low that 
no further testing is necessary (Figure 1-3)."
285,"Now consider Mr. B, a 60-year-old man, who smokes and has 
diabetes, hypertension, and 15 minutes of crushing substernal 
chest pain accompanied by nausea and diaphoresis, with an ECG 
showing ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads."
286,"The pretest 
probability of an acute MI is so high you would treat without 
further testing, such as measuring cardiac enzymes (Figure 1-4)."
287,"Diagnostic tests are necessary when the pretest probability of 
disease is in the middle, above the test threshold and below the treat -
ment threshold."
288,"A really useful test shifts the probability of disease 
so much that the posttest probability  (the probability of disease 
after the test is done) crosses one of the thresholds (Figure 1-5)."
289,"Test and treatment thresholds vary depending on the seriousness 
of the disease, the toxicity of the treatment, and the invasiveness 
of the test."
290,"For example, the treatment threshold for bacterial men -
ingitis is low: it is a potentially fatal disease and antibiotics are a 
relatively nontoxic treatment."

as chemotherapy or radiation therapy) have considerable toxicity,

Y ou are unable to find much information about estimating 
the pretest probability of cellulitis."
299,"Y ou consider the poten -
tial risk of starting antibiotics to be low, and your overall 
clinical impression is that the pretest probability of celluli -
tis is high enough to cross the treatment threshold, so you 
start antibiotics."
300,"Y ou consider the pretest probability of DVT to be low, 
but not so low you can exclude it without testing, especially 
given the potential seriousness of this diagnostic possibil -
ity."
301,"Y ou are able to find a CDR that helps you quantify the 
pretest probability and calculate that her pretest probabil -
ity is 17% (see Chapter 15)."
302,"Y ou have read that duplex ultrasonography is 
the best noninvasive test for DVT."
303,"How good 
is it?"
304,Will a negative test rule out DVT?
305,"UNDERSTANDING TEST RESUL TS 
How do I know whether a test is really 
useful—whether it will really shift the 
probability of disease across a threshold?"
306,"A perfect diagnostic test would always be positive in patients with 
the disease and would always be negative in patients without the 
disease (Figure 1-6)."
307,"Since there are no perfect diagnostic tests, 
some patients with the disease have negative tests (false-negative), 
and some without the disease have positive tests (false-positive) 
(Figure 1-7)."
308,"The test characteristics  help you to know how often false 
results occur."
309,"They are determined by performing the test in patients known to have or not have the disease and recording the 
distribution of results (Table 1-3)."
310,"Table 1-4 shows the test characteristics of duplex ultrasonog -
raphy for the diagnosis of proximal DVT, based on a hypothetical 
group of 200 patients, 90 of whom have DVT."
311,"The sensitivity  is the percentage of patients with DVT who 
have a true-positive (TP) test result:
Sensitivity = TP/total number of patients with DVT = 86/90 = 0.96 = 96%
Since tests with very high sensitivity have a very low percentage 
of false-negative results (in Table 1-4, 4/90 = 0.04 = 4%), a nega -
tive result is likely a true negative."
312,"The specificity  is the percentage of patients without DVT who

326,"Since tests with very high specificity have a low percentage of 
false-positive results (in Table 1-4, 2/110 = 0.02 = 2%), a positive 
result is likely a true positive."
327,"The sensitivity and specificity are important attributes of a 
test, but they do not tell you whether the test result will change 
your pretest probability enough to move beyond the test or treat -
ment thresholds; the shift in probability depends on the interac -
tions between sensitivity, specificity, and pretest probability."
328,"The 
likelihood ratio (LR),  the likelihood that a given test result would 
occur in a patient with the disease compared with the likelihood 
that the same result would occur in a patient without the disease, 
enables you to calculate how much the probability will shift."
329,"The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) tells you how likely it is that

disease probability; in general, tests with LR+ > 10 are very useful 
for ruling in disease."

shift in disease probability; in general, tests with LR– less than 0.1 
are very useful for ruling out disease."
335,"An LR– between 0.1 and 0.5 
causes a moderate shift in probability, and tests with these LRs are 
somewhat useful."
336,"The closer the LR is to 1, the less useful the test; tests with a 
LR = 1 do not change probability at all and are useless."
337,"The thresh -
old model in Figure 1-8 incorporates LRs and illustrates how tests 
can change disease probability."
338,"When you have a specific pretest probability, you can use the 
LR to calculate an exact posttest probability (see Box, Calculat -

PATIENT  1 
Mr. S is a healthy 45-year-old white man who wants to be 
“checked for everything.”
How do you know when it is worthwhile to 
screen for a disease?"
405,"Where do you find 
information on screening guidelines?"
406,"How do 
you interpret screening guidelines?"
407,"It seems intuitive that it is best to prevent a disease from occurring 
at all and next best to diagnose and treat it early."
408,"However, there are 
risks and benefits to every intervention, and it is especially impor -
tant to make sure an intervention is not going to harm a healthy 
individual."
409,"This chapter focuses on understanding the reasoning 
behind current screening practices."
410,A.
411,"Screening can be used to identify an unrecognized disease or 
risk factor in a seemingly well person."
412,B.
413,"Screening can be accomplished by collecting a thorough 
history, performing a physical examination, or obtaining 
laboratory tests."
414,"C. Examples of screening include mammography and cholesterol 
testing."
415,1.
416,"Mammography can detect unrecognized, asymptomatic 
breast cancer."
417,2.
418,"Cholesterol testing can be used
a."
419,"To identify high-risk individuals who do not yet 
have coronary disease (called primary prevention by 
clinicians)."
420,b.
421,"To prevent complications in patients with known 
coronary disease (called secondary prevention by 
clinicians, not actually screening)."
422,"D. The following criteria are helpful in determining whether 
screening for a disease is worthwhile:
1."
423,"The burden of disease must be sufficient to warrant 
screening."
424,a.
425,"Screen only for conditions that cause severe disease, 
disability, or death."
426,b.
427,"Consider prevalence of target disease and ability to 
identify high-risk group, since the yield of screening 
is higher in high-risk groups."
428,2.
429,The test used for screening must be of high quality.
430,a.
431,"Screening tests should accurately detect the target 
disease when it is asymptomatic."
432,b.
433,"Screening tests should have high sensitivity and 
specificity.c."
434,"Test results should be reproducible in a variety of 
settings."
435,d. Screening tests must be safe and acceptable to patients.
436,"e. Ideally, screening tests should be simple and shown to 
be cost effective."
437,3.
438,"There should be evidence that screening reduces morbidity 
or mortality."
439,a.
440,There must be effective treatment for the target disease.
441,b.
442,"Early detection followed by treatment must improve 
survival compared with detection and treatment at the 
usual time of presentation; in other words, people in 
whom the condition was diagnosed by screening should 
have better health outcomes than those in whom the 
condition was diagnosed clinically."
443,"c. The benefits of screening must outweigh any adverse 
effects of the screening test, treatment, or impact of 
early diagnosis."
444,"d. Ideally, benefits and harms are evaluated through a 
randomized trial of screening (Figure 2-1)."
445,"(1) The best outcome to measure is either all-cause 
mortality or disease-specific mortality, such as 
breast cancer or prostate cancer mortality."
446,"(2) Outcomes such as cancer stage distribution 
(ie, whether there are more or fewer early-stage 
cancers found) and length of survival after 
diagnosis can be misleading because of lead time 
and length time biases."
447,"(a) Lead time bias: If early treatment is not more 
effective than later treatment, the duration of

time the individual lives with the disease is longer, 
but the mortality rate is the same (Figure 2-2)."
451,"(b) Length time bias: Cancers that progress rapidly 
from onset to symptoms are less likely to 
be detected by screening than slow-growing 
cancers, so that screening tends to identify a 
group with a better prognosis."
452,"e. Often, screening decisions are made based on less 
direct evidence, such as cohort or case-control studies."
453,"Given the biases inherent in these study designs, this is 
suboptimal and has led to the institution of screening 
programs that provide no benefit."
454,"Where do you find information on screening 
guidelines?"
455,"Because of the complexity and rapid evolution of the evidence 
underlying screening recommendations, most physicians rely on 
published guidelines to inform them about screening decisions."
456,"Guidelines are developed and updated by a variety of organiza -
tions."
457,"It is important to be familiar with different sources of guide -
lines and to understand how to access the most recent versions of 
guidelines."

Commonly used tests For diagnosis:
Biopsy methods
  Fine-needle aspiration (sampling 
with a thin needle)
  Core biopsy (sampling with a wide 
needle)
 Incisional (part of mass is removed)
 Excisional (all of mass is removed)For staging:
Sentinel lymph node biopsy
 Performed at the time of surgery
 A radioactive blue dye is injected into the lymphatic system near the tumor
 The first node to take up dye is removed and analyzed microscopically
 If positive, other nodes may be removed
Histology Noninvasive
 DCIS
Invasive
 Ductal (76%)
 Lobular (10–15%): often multiple and bilateral
 Medullary
 Inflammatory: dermal lymphatic invasion with skin changes (peau d’orange)
 Paget disease of the nipple
Prognosis Based on the stage at the time of diagnosis
Overall 5-year survival is 90%
5-year survival for localized breast cancer is 98%
5-year survival for stage IV is 24%
Treatment Surgery
 Approach determined by tumor size, patient preference
 Lumpectomy
 Segmental mastectomy
 Total mastectomy
 Modified radical mastectomy
 Breast reconstruction at time of surgery or later
Radiation therapy
 After lumpectomy and sometimes mastectomy
Hormonal therapy
 Works best in cancers with estrogen/progesterone receptors
 Aromatase inhibitors such as exemestane, anastrozole
 Selective estrogen response modifiers such as tamoxifen
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) for HER2 /neu positive cancers
Chemotherapy indicated based on stage and biomarker profile
DCIS, ductal carcinoma in situ; LCIS, lobular carcinoma in situ."

Y ou explain to Mrs. S that in women with no factors that 
increase the risk of breast cancer, the chance that she will 
have a false-positive mammogram is much higher than the 
chance a breast cancer will be found."
1054,"Whether she should 
be screened prior to age 50 depends on her personal risk 
tolerance."
1055,Should Mrs. S be screened for osteoporosis?
1056,"Osteoporosis Screening
A."
1057,What is the burden of disease?
1058,1.
1059,"In the United States, about 10.3 million people over the 
age of 50 have osteoporosis (15.4% of women and 4.3% 
of men)."
1060,2.
1061,"The prevalence of osteoporosis is 25% in women aged 65 
or older and 5.6% in men aged 65 or older."
1062,3.
1063,"More than 2 million fractures per year are related to 
osteoporosis, including about 300,000 hip fractures and 
700,000 vertebral fractures."
1064,4.
1065,Mortality rate in the first year after hip fracture is 20%.
1066,B.
1067,"Is it possible to identify a high-risk group that might especially 
benefit from screening?"
1068,1.
1069,Low BMD itself is the strongest risk factor for fracture.
1070,2.
1071,"Increasing age is the strongest risk factor for low BMD; 
other risk factors include low body weight (< 132 pounds), 
lack of hormone replacement therapy use, family history 
of osteoporosis, personal history of fracture, ethnic group 
(white, Asian, Hispanic), current smoking, 3 or more 
alcoholic drinks/day, long-term corticosteroid use (≥ 5 mg 
of prednisone daily for ≥ 3 months)."
1072,3.
1073,"The WHO Fracture Risk Algorithm (FRAX) calculates the 
10-year probability of hip or major osteoporotic fracture 
using femoral neck BMD and clinical risk factors (available 
at http://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/)."
1074,a.
1075,"Although the full FRAX algorithm incorporates femoral 
neck BMD, it is possible to input just clinical risk 
factors to estimate the patient’s clinical risk."
1076,b.
1077,"Using just clinical risk factors, a 65-year-old woman 
with no additional positive answers has a 9.3% 10-year 
risk for any osteoporotic fracture."
1078,4.
1079,"The Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST) is designed 
to identify individuals more likely to have low BMD."
1080,"a. OST score = [weight (kg) – age (years)] × 0.2
b."
1081,Patients with a score of < 2 are considered high risk.
1082,5.
1083,"For identifying osteoporosis (T score ≤ –2.5), the FRAX 
has a sensitivity of 33.3% and specificity of 86.4% 
(LR+, 2.4; LR–, 0.77); the OST has a sensitivity of 79.3% 
and a specificity of 70.1% (LR+, 2.6; LR–, 0.29)."
1084,C. What is the quality of the screening test?
1085,1.
1086,"Background
a."
1087,"Can measure bone density with a variety of methods 
(dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, single-energy x-ray 
absorptiometry, ultrasonography, quantitative CT) at a 
variety of sites (hip, lumbar spine, heel, forearm)b."
1088,"Current bone density is compared with peak predicated 
bone density and then reported as number of SD above 
or below peak predicted bone density."
1089,"c. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density “T score” 
at least 2.5 SD below peak predicted bone density 
(T score = –2.5 or more negative)."
1090,d. Osteopenia is defined as a T score between –1.0 and –2.5.
1091,e. Normal is within 1 SD of peak predicted bone density.
1092,2.
1093,"Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry is the gold standard 
test."
1094,a.
1095,"Has been shown to be a strong predictor of hip fracture 
risk; femoral neck is best site to measure."
1096,b.
1097,"The relative risk of hip fracture is 2.5 for each decrease 
of 1 SD in bone density at the femoral neck."
1098,"c. The relative risk of vertebral fracture is 1.9 for each 
decrease of 1 SD in bone density at the femoral neck."
1099,3.
1100,"There are limited data regarding the optimal interval 
between screening exams."
1101,a.
1102,"One study found that a repeat bone density 8 years after 
the initial test did not improve fracture risk prediction 
when compared with the initial test."
1103,b.
1104,"Another study stratified patients by baseline bone 
density and then determined the estimated time 
interval for 10% of women in each cohort to develop 
osteoporosis or an osteoporotic fracture."
1105,"(1) For women with a normal BMD (T score, –1.0 or 
higher), the interval was 16 years."
1106,"(2) For women with mild osteopenia (T score, –1.01 to 
–1.49), the interval was 17 years."
1107,"(3) For women with moderate osteopenia (T score, 
–1.50 to –1.99), the interval was 5 years; for those 
with advanced osteopenia (T score, –2.0 to –2.49), 
the interval was 1 year."
1108,D. Does screening reduce morbidity or mortality?
1109,1.
1110,"No studies of the effectiveness of screening in reducing 
osteoporotic fractures
2."
1111,"Many studies show treatment substantially reduces fracture 
risk."
1112,3.
1113,"Potential harms of screening include misinterpretation of 
test results, increasing anxiety in patients, side effects of 
medications, and cost."
1114,4.
1115,"If 10,000 women aged 65–69 are screened, assuming a 
12% prevalence of osteoporosis and that treatment reduces 
vertebral fracture by 50% and hip fracture by 66%

435 and for hip fracture is 1000.
c. In women aged 75–79 (osteoporosis prevalence 28%),

I have a patient with abdominal pain."
1177,How do I determine the cause?
1178,"CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1 
Mr. C is a 22-year-old man who complains of diffuse abdom -
inal pain."
1179,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
abdominal pain?"
1180,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
1181,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Abdominal pain is the most common cause for hospital admis -
sion in the United States."
1182,"Diagnoses range from benign entities 
(eg,  irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]) to life-threatening diseases 
(eg,  ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms [AAAs])."
1183,"The first 
pivotal step in diagnosing abdominal pain is to identify the 
location  of the pain."
1184,"The differential diagnosis can then be limited 
to a subset of conditions that cause pain in that particular quadrant 
of the abdomen (Figure 3-1)."
1185,"Several other pivotal points can help narrow the differential 
diagnosis including (1) the time course of the pain, (2) peritoneal 
findings on exam, (3) unexplained hypotension, and (4) abdomi -
nal distention."
1186,Each of these is reviewed below.
1187,The time course of the pain is a pivotal feature.
1188,"Some diseases 
present subacutely/chronically over weeks to months or years 
(eg, IBS) whereas others present acutely, within hours to days of 
onset (eg, appendicitis)."
1189,"In patients with their first episode of acute 
severe abdominal pain, a variety of life-threatening, must not miss 
diagnoses must be considered (eg, AAA)."
1190,"Many of these diseases 
that cause acute abdominal pain cannot recur because patients are 
either treated or die of complications (eg, AAA, acute appendicitis, 
splenic rupture.)"
1191,"Since prior episodes are incompatible with many 
of these diagnoses, a history of such prior episodes narrows the dif -
ferential diagnosis."
1192,"Therefore, the differential diagnosis of abdomi -
nal pain can be organized based on whether patients are presenting 
with their (1) first episode of acute abdominal pain, (2) a recurrent 
episode of acute abdominal pain, or (3) chronic/subacute abdom -
inal pain."
1193,"Table 3-1 outlines the typical time course associated 
with different diseases causing abdominal pain."
1194,"See Table 3-2 for 
a summary of abdominal pain organized by location, time course, 
and clinical clues."
1195,"Peritoneal findings of rebound tenderness, rigidity, and guard -
ing are pivotal features and suggest an intra-abdominal catastro -
phe."
1196,"Typical causes include AAA, bowel infarction (due to bowel 
obstruction or acute mesenteric ischemia), bowel perforation 
(due to appendicitis, peptic ulcer disease [PUD], diverticulitis), 
pancreatitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).Unexplained  hypotension is yet another potential pivotal clue."
1197,"While many patients with abdominal pain experience hypotension 
due to dehydration from nausea, vomiting, or poor oral intake, 
some patients with abdominal pain present with unexplained  
hypotension."
1198,"Unexplained hypotension can suggest sepsis, retro -
peritoneal hemorrhage, or other diseases."
1199,"Table 3-3 lists diseases 
associated with abdominal pain and unexplained hypotension."
1200,"Orthostatic vital signs should be taken in 
patients with abdominal pain."
1201,"They may 
provide invaluable diagnostic and therapeutic 
information."
1202,"The final pivotal finding is significant abdominal distention, 
which may develop from excess air or fluid in the abdomen."
1203,"Excess air may occur with bowel obstruction or bowel perforation 
(free air)."
1204,"Excess fluid may be seen in patients with ascites or hem -
orrhage."
1205,"Percussion and shifting dullness can usually distinguish 
excess air from fluid in such patients."
1206,"Table 3-4 lists the diagnostic 
considerations in patients with abdominal distention."
1207,"Other important historical points include factors that make the 
pain better or worse (eg, eating), its’ quality, radiation of the pain, 
and associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, inability to 
pass stool and flatus, melena, hematochezia, change in color of the 
urine or stool, jaundice, fever, chills, weight loss, altered bowel hab -
its, orthostatic symptoms, urinary symptoms) or prior abdominal 
surgeries (increasing the risk of small bowel obstruction [SBO])."
1208,"Pulmonary symptoms or a cardiac history can be clues to pneu -
monia or myocardial infarction presenting as abdominal pain."
1209,"In 
women, sexual and menstrual histories are important."
1210,"The patient 
should be asked about alcohol consumption as well as prescription 
and over-the-counter medications and supplements."
1211,"A few final points about the physical exam are worth empha-
sizing."
1212,"First, vital signs are just that, vital."
1213,"Hypotension, fever, tach-
ypnea, and tachycardia are critical clinical clues that must not be 
overlooked."
1214,The HEENT exam should look for pallor or icterus.
1215,Jaundice suggests either hepatitis or biliary disease.
1216,"Careful heart 
and lung exams can suggest pneumonia or other extra-abdominal 
causes of abdominal pain."
1217,"The physical exam of a patient with abdominal 
pain includes more than just the abdominal 
exam."
1218,"Of course, the abdominal exam is key."
1219,"Inspection assesses 
for distention as noted above."
1220,"Auscultation evaluates whether 
bowel sounds are present."
1221,"Absent bowel sounds may suggest an 
intra-abdominal catastrophe; high-pitched tinkling sounds and 
rushes suggest an intestinal obstruction."
1222,"Palpation should be 
performed last."
1223,"It is useful to distract the patient by continuing to 
talk with him or her during abdominal palpation ."

T extbook Presentation
The classic presentation of appendicitis is abdominal pain that is 
initially diffuse and then intensifies and migrates toward the right 
lower quadrant (RLQ) to McBurney point (1.5–2 inches from 
the anterior superior iliac crest toward umbilicus)."
1279,"Patients often 
complain of bloating and anorexia."
1280,"Disease Highlights
A. Appendicitis is one of the most common causes of an acute 
abdomen, with a 7% lifetime occurrence rate."
1281,B.
1282,"It develops secondary to obstruction of the appendiceal orifice 
with secondary mucus accumulation, swelling, ischemia, 
necrosis, and perforation."
1283,"C. Initially, the pain is poorly localized."
1284,"However, progressive 
inflammation eventually involves the parietal peritoneum, 
resulting in pain localized to the RLQ."
1285,D. The risk of perforation increases steadily with age.

Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
1290,"The classic presentation of nausea and vomiting with pain 
migration from the periumbilical area to the RLQ is present in 
only 50–65% of patients.B."
1291,"RLQ pain is the most useful clinical finding; LR+, 7.3–8.5; 
LR–, 0.0–0.3
C. Most of the clinical findings have low sensitivity for 
appendicitis making it difficult to rule out the diagnosis."
1292,1.
1293,"In one study, guarding was completely absent in 22% of 
patients, and rebound was completely absent in 16% of 
patients with appendicitis."
1294,2.
1295,"Fever was present in only 40% of patients with perforated 
appendices."
1296,"Fever, severe tenderness, guarding, and rebound 
may be absent in patients with appendicitis."
1297,"D. Nonetheless, certain findings increase the likelihood of 
appendicitis when present (ie, rebound, guarding) (Table 3-6)."
1298,"E. Symptoms are different in octogenarians than in patients aged 
60–79 years."

Mr. C’s symptoms are consistent with—but certainly not diagnos -
tic of—appendicitis."
1374,"He has no risk factors for any of the alterna -
tive diagnoses of pancreatitis, PUD, or bowel obstruction (alcohol 
use, NSAID ingestion, or prior abdominal surgery, respectively)."
1375,"Diagnostic options include obtaining a complete blood count 
(CBC) (always done but clearly of limited value), continued obser -
vation and reexamination, surgical consultation, and obtaining a 
CT scan."
1376,"Given the lack of evidence for any of the less concerning 
possibilities, you remain concerned that the patient has early appen -
dicitis."
1377,"You elect to observe the patient, obtain a CBC and lipase, 
order a CT scan and ask for a surgical consult."
1378,"Frequent clinical observations are exceptionally 
useful when evaluating a patient with possible 
appendicitis."
1379,"1
The CBC reveals a WBC of 8700/mcL (86% neutrophils, 
0% bands) and an HCT of 44%."
1380,The lipase is normal.
1381,"On reex -
amination the patient complains that the pain is now more 
severe in the RLQ."
1382,"On exam, he is moderately tender but still 
without rebound or guarding."
1383,The migration of pain to the RLQ is suggestive of appendicitis.
1384,"Less likely considerations might include Crohn ileitis as well as 
diverticulitis or colon cancer (both unlikely in this age group)."
1385,"If 
the patient were a woman, PID and ovarian pathology (ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, or ruptured ovarian cyst) would 
also need to be considered."
1386,"Diffuse abdominal pain that subsequently 
localizes and becomes more constant, suggests

PATIENT  2
Ms. R is a 50-year-old woman who comes to the office com -
plaining of abdominal pain."
1397,"The patient reports that she has 
been having “episodes” or “attacks” of abdominal pain over 
the last month, with about 3 “attacks” during this time."
1398,"The 
last attack was 4 days previously."
1399,"She reports that the 
attacks of pain are in the epigastrium, last up to 4 hours, 
and often awaken her at night."
1400,"The pain is described as a 
severe cramping-like sensation that is very intense and 
steady for hours."
1401,"Occasionally, the pain radiates to the 
right back."
1402,The pain is associated with emesis.
1403,"She reports 
that the color of her urine and stool are normal."
1404,"On physical 
exam, her vital signs are stable."
1405,She is afebrile.
1406,"On HEENT 
exam, she is anicteric."
1407,"Her lungs are clear, and cardiac

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
1412,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The first pivotal feature of Ms. R’s abdominal pain is its epigastric 
location."
1413,"Common causes of epigastric pain include PUD, pancreati -
tis, and biliary colic (Figure 3-1)."
1414,"The second pivotal feature of Ms. R’s 
abdominal pain is its time course, with multiple acute episodes."
1415,"Many 
diseases cause well-defined recurrent discrete episodes of abdominal 
pain (Table 3-1) but of these, only pancreatitis and biliary colic tend 
to occur in the epigastrium."
1416,"PUD is a common cause of epigastric 
abdominal pain and obviously needs to be considered."
1417,"However, the 
pain in PUD is typically more chronic than acute, and not typically 
discrete or so severe, making this a less likely possibility."
1418,"Ms. R does 
not have other pivotal clues such as peritoneal findings, unexplained 
hypotension, or abdominal distention that could focus the differential."
1419,The final clinical clue is the severe crampy quality of the pain.
1420,"Severe 
intense crampy abdominal pain (“colicky”) suggests obstruction of 
a hollow viscera, which can be caused by biliary, bowel, or ureteral 
obstruction (due to biliary stones, bowel obstruction, or nephrolithia -
sis, respectively)."
1421,"Taken together, the epigastric location, multiple dis -
crete episodes, quality and intensity of the pain, make biliary colic the 
leading hypothesis."
1422,Table 3-8 lists the differential diagnosis.
1423,"2
Ms. R reports no history of alcohol binging, NSAID use, or 
known PUD."
1424,The pain does not improve with food or antacids.

1517,"Given this

ordered?"
1518,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
This episode of abdominal pain raises several possibilities."
1519,"The first 
is that the current symptom complex is in some way related to her 
known cholelithiasis."
1520,"The persistent pain suggests either cholecys -
titis (due to a stone lodged in the cystic duct), choledocholithiasis, 
ascending cholangitis, or pancreatitis."
1521,"Of note, her dark urine is a 
pivotal clinical clue."
1522,"Both hematuria and bilirubinuria can cause 
dark urine."
1523,"Bilirubinuria only occurs in patients with conjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia which, in turn, is due to either CBD obstruction 
or hepatitis."
1524,"In Ms. R, the preexistent biliary colic, persistent RUQ 
pain, and dark urine make the most likely diagnosis CBD obstruc -
tion due to migration of a stone into the CBD (choledocholithiasis) 
(Figure 3-2)."
1525,"Conversely, this symptom complex is not consistent 
with cholecystitis."
1526,"In uncomplicated cholecystitis, only the cystic 
duct is obstructed."
1527,"Since the CBD  is not obstructed, bile flows 
unimpeded into the bowel, and does not back up into the liver."
1528,"Therefore, such patients do not develop hyperbilirubinemia, biliru -
binuria, dark urine, or significant increases in ALT or AST."
1529,"Finally, 
Ms. R’s fever suggests that the CBD obstruction has been compli -
cated by ascending infection and taken together suggests ascending 
cholangitis, a life-threatening condition."
1530,"Dark urine suggests bilirubinuria and may 
precede icterus."
1531,"Rigors (defined as visible shaking or teeth 
chattering chills) suggests bacteremia 
and should increase the suspicion of a 
life-threatening bacterial infection."
1532,"Other considerations include hepatitis or pancreatitis (which may 
be caused by concomitant pancreatic duct obstruction)."
1533,"While hep -
atitis can cause RUQ pain, hyperbilirubinemia, and bilirubinuria, it 
would also require giving Ms. R another unrelated diagnosis and is 
therefore less likely."
1534,Table 3-9 lists the differential diagnosis.
1535,"2
Laboratory results include WBC 17,000/mcL (84% neu -
trophils, 10% bands)."

PATIENT  3
Mr. J is a previously healthy 63-year-old man with severe 
abdominal pain for 48 hours."
1777,"The pain is periumbilical with 
severe crampy exacerbations that last for several min -
utes and then subside."
1778,"He notes loud intestinal noises 
(borborygmi) during the periods of increased pain."
1779,"The pain 
is associated with nausea and vomiting."
1780,He denies diarrhea.
1781,"He reports decreased appetite with no oral intake in the 
last 48 hours."
1782,He denies having this pain previously.
1783,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
1784,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
1785,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The first pivotal point for Mr. J’s abdominal pain is its periumbilical 
location."
1786,"A variety of diseases present with pain in this location, 
including AAA, appendicitis (early), bowel ischemia, bowel 
obstruction, diabetic ketoacidosis, gastroenteritis, IBS, and IBD 
(Figure 3-1)."
1787,"The second useful pivotal point to consider is the time 
course of Mr. J’s abdominal pain (Table 3-1)."
1788,"This allows us to fur -
ther limit the differential diagnosis to those diseases causing acute  
periumbilical pain."
1789,"Typically, IBS and IBD do not cause acute pain."
1790,"Furthermore, diabetic ketoacidosis is unlikely (unless this is his 
presentation of diabetes)."
1791,"Gastroenteritis is also unlikely given the 
absence of diarrhea and the severity of the pain."
1792,"Finally, Mr. J’s severe 
crampy abdominal pain suggests some type of visceral obstruction."
1793,"The syndromes associated with pain of this quality include ure -
teral obstruction secondary to kidney stones, biliary obstruction, or intestinal obstruction (large or small bowel)."
1794,"The associated nau -
sea and vomiting can be seen with any of those diseases."
1795,"However, 
the combination of the location of the pain and the loud intestinal 
sounds that accompany the pain makes bowel obstruction the lead -
ing hypothesis."
1796,"It will also be important to determine whether he 
has unexplained hypotension or abdominal distention during his 
exam."
1797,Table 3-11 lists the differential diagnoses for Mr. J.
1798,"3
Considering each hypothesis in turn (Table 3-11), Mr. J 
reports no change in his bowel habits until 4 days ago."
1799,"Since 
that time, he has been constipated and unable to pass 
stool or flatus."
1800,"He also notes that 3 weeks ago, he saw a 
small amount of blood on the stool."
1801,"He has no prior history 
of intra-abdominal surgeries, hernias, or diverticulitis."
1802,"He 
does not have a smoking history (which increases the risk 
for AAA) and states that the pain does not radiate to his 
back."
1803,"He has no risk factors for acute mesenteric ischemia 
(no prior history of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart dis -
ease or known hypercoagulable state)."
1804,"On physical exam, 
he is intermittently very uncomfortable with episodes of 
severe diffuse cramping pain."
1805,"Vital signs reveal orthostatic 
hypotension: supine BP , 110/75 mm Hg; pulse, 90 bpm; 
upright BP , 85/50 mm Hg; pulse, 125 bpm; temperature, 
37.0°C; RR, 18 breaths per minute."
1806,He is anicteric.
1807,"Cardiac 
and lung exams are unremarkable."
1808,"On abdominal inspection 
there is prominent distention."
1809,"Auscultation shows inter -
mittent rushes."
1810,"P ercussion is tympanitic and on palpation 
there is mild diffuse tenderness to exam without rebound 
or guarding."
1811,Stool is brown and heme positive.
1812,"The constipation, absence of flatus, and rushing bowel sounds 
further increase the suspicion of bowel obstruction."
1813,"The tympanitic 
abdominal distention is a pivotal finding suggesting accumulation 
of air in the abdomen, in this case most likely due to obstruction."

hyperactive early in the course."

ent."
1832,(Distention is less prominent in proximal SBOs.)
1833,"At first, the 
pain is intermittent; later, the pain often becomes more constant, 
bowel sounds may diminish and become absent, constipation 
progresses, and the patient becomes unable to pass flatus."

Three distinct clinical subtypes of ischemic bowel include chronic 
mesenteric ischemia (chronic small bowel ischemia), acute mesen -

Mr. L has severe, diffuse, and acute abdominal pain."
2083,"The first 
pivotal point evaluates the location of the pain."
2084,"Mr. L ’s pain is 
diffuse, which limits the differential diagnosis."
2085,"Common causes 
of diffuse mid abdominal pain include IBS; IBD; SBO or LBO; 
acute ischemia; AAA; diabetic ketoacidosis; gastroenteritis; and, 
given the radiation of pain to his back, pancreatitis, and nephro -
lithiasis (Figure 3-1)."
2086,"Although this is an extensive differential, it 
can be focused further."
2087,"Several of these diagnoses are very unlikely 
and need not be considered further."
2088,"Given the lack of diarrhea and 
the severity of pain, gastroenteritis is very unlikely."
2089,"His continued 
bowel movements and flatus make bowel obstruction unlikely 
(although this can be seen early in obstruction.)"
2090,"The lack of a his -
tory of diabetes would make diabetic ketoacidosis unlikely, unless 
this was the initial presentation; a simple blood sugar could help 
exclude this diagnosis."
2091,"The second pivotal point which can serve 
to narrow the differential diagnosis is the time course of the pain, 
which is hyperacute."
2092,"Of the remaining hypotheses, AAA, bowel 
ischemia, pancreatitis, and nephrolithiasis can all present acutely, 
whereas this would be very unlikely presentation of IBD or IBS."
2093,"The radiation to the left flank increases the likelihood of AAA, 
nephrolithiasis, and pancreatitis."
2094,"Clearly, AAA is a must not miss 
diagnosis."
2095,"Other pivotal findings that can help narrow the differ -
ential diagnosis include peritoneal findings on exam, unexplained 
hypotension and abdominal distention."
2096,"Table 3-14 lists the differ -
ential diagnoses for Mr. L.
4
Exploring each one of the hypotheses, Mr. L has no history 
of kidney stones or hematuria."
2097,He does not drink alcohol.
2098,"He 
has no history of atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, 
or hypercoagulable states."
2099,"On reexamination, orthostatic 
maneuvers reveal profound orthostatic hypotension."
2100,"Supine 
BP and pulse were 110/65 mm Hg and 90 bpm."
2101,"Upon stand -
ing his BP falls to 65/40 mm Hg and a pulse of 140 bpm."
2102,He remains afebrile.
2103,"Again, you find that he lacks rebound or 
guarding and has moderate flank and back tenderness to 
percussion."
2104,"His abdominal aorta cannot be palpated due to 
his abdominal girth."
2105,Lower extremity pulses are intact.
2106,"Plain 
abdominal radiographs do not demonstrate free air."
2107,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"
2108,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
2109,"The most dramatic and important pivotal physical finding is 
the presence of profound orthostatic hypotension."
2110,"It is critical 
to appreciate that his hypotension is clearly out of proportion to 
dehydration since he has only vomited once and his decreased oral 
intake only began 1 hour ago."
2111,"As noted above unexplained  hypoten -
sion is a pivotal finding that must be explained."
2112,"The lack of dehy -
dration suggests that the orthostatic hypotension is due to either 
intra-abdominal hemorrhage or sepsis (Table 3-3)."
2113,"He has no fever 
or chills to suggest sepsis, but this is still possible."
2114,"A serious con -
sideration is therefore massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage, either 
within the gastrointestinal tract or intraperitoneal."
2115,"Massive gastro -
intestinal hemorrhage always exits the bowel quickly resulting in 
obvious clinical findings, such as hematemesis, melena, or hema -
tochezia, and is rarely subtle."
2116,"Therefore, you are more concerned 
about intraperitoneal hemorrhage."
2117,"Causes of massive intraperito -
neal hemorrhage include AAA rupture, splenic rupture, or rupture 
of an ectopic pregnancy."
2118,"The patient’s history is most suggestive of 
AAA rupture."
2119,You call for a stat vascular surgery consult.Orthostatic hypotension is always important.
2120,"It 
significantly influences the differential diagnosis 
and the diagnostic and management decisions, 
and it may be marked despite a normal supine  
BP and pulse."

5."
2257,"Other: cystine and indinavir stones
C. Pathophysiology
1."
2258,"Stones form when the concentration of salts (ie, calcium, 
oxalate, or uric acid) becomes supersaturated in the urine 
resulting in precipitation and crystallization."
2259,2.
2260,"Supersaturation is secondary to a combination of increased 
urinary salt excretion combined with inadequate diluting 
urinary volume."
2261,"Numerous mechanisms can contribute to 
an increase in urinary mineral excretion including:
a. Calcium: idiopathic hypercalciuria, hypercalcemic 
disorders, primary hyperparathyroidism, 
immobilization, excessive sodium intake (which 
increases calcium excretion), systemic acidosis, and 
excessive vitamin D supplementation
b. Uric acid: Excessive dietary purines, myeloproliferative 
disorders, uricosuric agents (for the treatment of gout), 
and metabolic syndrome."
2262,"Low urine pH also contributes 
to uric acid stone formation."
2263,"Hyperuricosuria can 
lead to uric acid stones or calcium stones due to 
heterogeneous ossification."
2264,"c. Oxalate: Increased excretion may be secondary to 
excessive oxalate intake (rhubarb, spinach, chocolate, 
nuts, vitamin C) and/or increased oxalate absorption."
2265,(1) Fat malabsorption increases  oxalate absorption.
2266,"The unabsorbed fat competes with oxalate to bind 
calcium leading to more intraluminal oxalate that is 
not bound to calcium."
2267,"Unbound oxalate is absorbed 
and excreted in the urine."
2268,"(2) Causes of fat malabsorption include short bowel 
syndrome, IBD, celiac disease, and bariatric 
surgery."
2269,3.
2270,"In some patients, a decrease in urinary stone inhibitors 
(urinary citrate) also contribute to stone formation."
2271,4.
2272,"Infection with urea-splitting organisms (ie, Proteus ) plays a 
key role in the formation of struvite stones (MgNH4PO4)."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Mr. L is a 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
(DM) who complains of weakness, anorexia, and vomiting."
2580,Laboratory studies demonstrate a HCO3− of 6 mEq/L.
2581,"His very low HCO3− suggests a significant acid-base abnormal -
ity."
2582,"In addition to evaluating his abdominal pain, exploring his 
acid-base disorder is critical."
2583,"What is the differential diagnosis of acid-
base disorders?"
2584,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
2585,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of acid-base disorders is extensive 
(Table 4-1) but can easily be organized into 4 distinct subsets by first 
determining whether the primary  disorder is a (1) metabolic acido -
sis, (2) metabolic alkalosis, (3) respiratory acidosis, or (4) respiratory 
alkalosis."
2586,"The key pivotal feature that allows the clinician to narrow 
the differential to 1 of these subsets is to first evaluate the pH and 
then the HCO3− and PaCO2."
2587,"Step 1: Determine Whether the Primary 
Disorder is an Acidosis or Alkalosis by 
Reviewing the pH1."
2588,A. pH < 7.4 indicates the primary  disorder is an acidosis.
2589,B. pH > 7.4 indicates the primary  disorder is an alkalosis.
2590,"Step 2: Determine Whether the Primary Acidosis 
or Alkalosis is Metabolic or Respiratory by 
Reviewing the HCO3− and PaCO2
A."
2591,Recall that CO2 + H2O ⇔ H2CO3 ⇔ HCO3− + H+; thereforeB.
2592,"PaCO2 changes drive pH as follows:
1."
2593,"Increased PaCO2 drives reaction to right: This increases H+ 
which lowers pH, resulting in a respiratory acidosis ."
2594,2.
2595,"Decreased PaCO2 drives reaction to left: This decreases H+ 
which raises pH, resulting in a respiratory alkalosis ."
2596,"C. HCO3− changes drive pH as follows:
1."
2597,"Increasing HCO3− drives the reaction to left: This consumes 
H+ which raises the pH, resulting in a metabolic alkalosis ."
2598,2.
2599,"Decreasing HCO3− drives the reaction to the right: This 
increases H+ which lowers the pH, resulting in a metabolic 
acidosis ."
2600,"This occurs in 2 situations:
a."
2601,"Processes that produce H+ ion (and consume HCO3−) 
(ie, ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis)
b."
2602,"Processes that lose HCO3− (ie, diarrhea)
D. For acidosis (pH < 7.4)
1."
2603,"HCO3− < 24 mEq/L: The primary disorder is a metabolic 
acidosis
2."
2604,"PaCO2 > 40 mm Hg: The primary disorder is a respiratory 
acidosis
E. For alkalosis (pH > 7.4)
1."
2605,"HCO3− > 24 mEq/L: The primary disorder is a metabolic 
alkalosis
2."
2606,"PaCO2 < 40 mm Hg: The primary disorder is a respiratory 
alkalosis
This is summarized in Table 4-2."
2607,"Step 3: Narrow the Differential Diagnoses 
of Metabolic Acidosis by Calculating the 
Anion Gap
The differential diagnosis for metabolic acidosis is extensive but 
can be narrowed based on whether the anion gap is normal or 
elevated."
2608,The anion gap is an estimate of the unmeasured anions.
2609,"As noted above, metabolic acidoses may be caused by processes 
that either (1) produce acid (ie, ketoacids, lactic acid, sulfates, 
phosphates, or other organic acids), or by (2) processes that lose 
HCO3− in the urine or stool (ie, diarrhea)."
2610,"Processes that produce 
acid (eg,  ketoacidosis) also produce their associated unmeasured 
anions, which accumulate, resulting in an increased anion gap."
2611,"Therefore, an elevated anion gap suggests one of those processes is 
the cause of the metabolic acidosis."
2612,"On the other hand, processes 
that lose HCO3− do not generate unmeasured anions and the anion 
gap remains normal."
2613,"Therefore, this simple calculation can help 
focus the differential diagnosis (Table 4-1)."
2614,"A. Anion gap = Na+ – (HCO3− + Cl−)
B."
2615,"12 ± 4 is often cited as an ideal cutoff, although in some insti -
tutions, a normal anion gap is only 7–9 mEq/L.1 The pH and PaCO2 are typically measured utilizing an arterial blood 
gas (ABG.)"
2616,"Alternatively, a peripheral venous blood gas (VBG) can be used 
to estimate the pH."
2617,"A meta-analysis suggested the VBG pH was similar but 
slightly lower (0.033) than the arterial pH (0.015–0.051)."
2618,"However, the 
venous PCO2 did not reliably predict the arterial PaCO2."
2619,"Venous PaCO2 
was higher with a wide and unpredictable range (from –10.7 to +2.4) and 
should not be used to evaluate acid-base disturbances.I have a patient with an acid-base abnormality."

Unfortunately, many patients have more than one simultaneous

2648,"T wo final steps help clinicians recognize 
these situations."
2649,"Step 6A: Calculate Anion Gap ( Even in Patients 
Without Acidosis ) to Uncover Unexpected 
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis
Patients may have a simultaneous metabolic alkalosis (raising 
the HCO3−) and an anion gap acidosis (lowering the HCO3−)."
2650,"Depending on which is more severe, the HCO3− can be low, nor -
mal, or high."
2651,"If the HCO3− is normal or high, it is easy to overlook 
the anion gap metabolic acidosis (which may be quite important.)"
2652,"Since the anion gap would remain elevated if an anion gap meta -
bolic acidosis is present, a quick check of the anion gap can be an 
important clue to an otherwise unnoticed metabolic acidosis."
2653,Always check the anion gap.
2654,"An elevated gap 
suggests an anion gap metabolic acidosis even 
when the HCO3− is above normal."
2655,"Step 6B: Calculate Whether Compensation 
Is Appropriate
A."
2656,The acid-base system attempts to maintain homeostasis.
2657,"Alterations in the respiratory or metabolic system trigger 
compensatory changes in the other system to minimize the 
change of pH."
2658,"For instance, in metabolic acidosis, the respi -
ratory system hyperventilates to lower the PaCO2 and thereby 
create a respiratory alkalosis  that returns the pH closer  to 
normal (but never quite to normal)."
2659,"Table 4-3 illustrates the 
direction of the compensatory change in acid-base disorders.B."
2660,"Formulas predict the expected change in PaCO2 to com -
pensate for metabolic processes and the expected change in 
HCO3− to compensate for respiratory processes (Table 4-4)."
2661,"C. Compensation that is greater or less than expected suggests 
that an additional  acid-base abnormality is present not just 
compensation."
2662,"D. If an additional process is implicated, the differential diagnosis 
for that additional disorder should be explored."

2700,"Leading Hypothesis: DKA
T extbook Presentation
DKA often begins with an acute illness (ie, pneumonia, urinary tract 
infection, myocardial infarction [MI]) or nonadherence to insulin 
in a patient with type 1 DM."
2701,"Patients often complain of symptoms 
related to hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia) and 
to the precipitating illness (eg, fever, cough, dysuria, chest pain)."
2702,"Nonspecific complaints are common (nausea, vomiting, abdominal

pain, and weakness)."
2703,"Patients are profoundly dehydrated and exhibit 
orthostatic changes or frank hypotension."
2704,"Confusion, lethargy, and 
coma may occur secondary to dehydration, hyperglycemia, acidosis, 
or the underlying precipitating event."
2705,"Disease Highlights
A."
2706,"Occurs primarily in patients with complete or near complete 
insulin deficiency

2707,"Type 1 autoimmune insulin-dependent DM
2."
2708,"Type 2 DM can cause DKA
a."
2709,"Type 2 DM accounts for 12–47% DKA episodes
b. DKA complicating type 2 DM is more frequently found 
in diabetic blacks and Hispanics than non-Hispanic 
whites."
2710,"(Up to 47% of Hispanic diabetics with DKA 
had type 2 DM.)"
2711,"c. Many such patients can eventually be treated with oral 
hypoglycemics without insulin after a short period of 
insulin therapy."
2712,Many cases of DKA occur in type 2 DM.

hormones counterregulatory to insulin (cortisol, epinephrine, 
glucagon, and growth hormone), or both."

a."
2725,"Other infections
b. MI
c. Cerebrovascular accident
d. Acute pancreatitis
e. Pulmonary embolism
f. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
g. Severe emotional stress
4."
2726,"Medications and drugs implicated in DKA include:
a."
2727,"Failure of insulin pumps, and use of corticosteroids, 
thiazides, cocaine, antipsychotics."
2728,"b. SGLT2 inhibitors used to treat diabetes have also caused 
DKA in some patients."
2729,"(1) The mechanism includes decreased release  of insulin 
(due to the lower glucose levels), direct stimulation 
of glucagon release, and ketogenic effects)."
2730,"(2) Risk may be accentuated in patients undergoing 
stressful events, such as surgery."
2731,"(3) May be appropriate to avoid with concurrent 
insulin use(4) Risk may be higher in patients with lower insulin 
levels, such as LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes 
of the adult)."
2732,"(5) Due to glucosuria, DKA in these patients is 
often associated with near normal glucose levels  
(mean 265 mg/dL)."
2733,"Therefore, a high index of 
suspicion of DKA must be maintained."
2734,D. Pathogenesis of DKA: (Figure 4-2).
2735,"The marked  decrease in 
insulin levels together with an increase in counterregulatory 
hormones lead to the following events:
1."
2736,"Hyperglycemia: Caused by
a."
2737,"Marked insulin deficiency reduces cellular uptake of 
glucose
b."
2738,"Increased hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
c. Oliguria: Hyperglycemia leads to an osmotic diuresis 
(polyuria) and dehydration."
2739,"Oliguria eventually 
develops, which limits urinary glucose loss and thereby 
aggravates hyperglycemia."
2740,2.
2741,"Ketoacidosis
a."
2742,"Marked insulin deficiency increases glucagon which, in 
turn, increases acetyl CoA production within liver."
2743,b.
2744,"Massive production of acetyl CoA overwhelms Krebs 
cycle resulting in ketone production and ketonemia 
(primarily beta hydroxybutyric acid and to a lesser 
extent acetoacetic acid)."
2745,c. Ketonemia leads to anion gap metabolic acidosis.
2746,3.
2747,"Volume depletion: Ketonemia and hyperglycemia cause an 
osmotic diuresis, which results in profound dehydration 
and typical fluid losses of 3–6 L.
4."
2748,"Potassium loss
a."
2749,"The osmotic diuresis also causes significant potassium 
losses."
2750,"b. Dehydration-induced hyperaldosteronism aggravates 
potassium loss."
2751,c. Typical potassium deficit is 3–5 mEq/kg body weight.
2752,5.
2753,"Hyperkalemia
a."
2754,"Despite the total body potassium deficit, hyper kalemia 
is frequent."
2755,b.
2756,The etiology is multifactorial.
2757,"(1) Insulin normally drives glucose and potassium into 
the cells."
2758,"Insulin deficiency  decreases cellular uptake 
and causes hyperkalemia."
2759,"(2) Plasma hypertonicity drives water and potassium 
out of the cells and into the intravascular 
compartment accentuating the hyperkalemia."
2760,6.
2761,"Hyponatremia
a."
2762,"As noted above, the hyperglycemia and ketonemia 
create an osmotic diuresis and free water loss
b."
2763,"Despite this free water loss, many patients with DKA 
have hyponatremia."
2764,"c. Hyponatremia occurs because the hyperglycemia forces 
an osmotic efflux of water from the intracellular space 
into the extracellular space, diluting the serum sodium."
2765,"d. The elevated serum osmolality also stimulates 
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release, which further 
aggravates the hyponatremia."
2766,"e. With treatment , the glucose (and water) shifts 
intracellularly, increasing the serum sodium which 
may actually rise above normal due to the water 
deficit."

acidosis?"
2915,"Do other tests need to be done to 
exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
2916,"Alternative Diagnosis: Uremic Acidosis
T extbook Presentation
Typically, patients with chronic kidney disease have low HCO3− 
levels, high creatinine levels (often > 4–5 mg/dL), and elevated 
BUN and phosphate levels."
2917,"Patients often complain of a variety of 
constitutional symptoms secondary to their kidney disease, includ -
ing fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and pruritus."
2918,"Disease Highlights
A. Pathophysiology
1."
2919,"Each day, ingested nonvolatile acids neutralize HCO3−."
2920,2.
2921,"In health, the kidneys regenerate the HCO3− and maintain 
the acid-base equilibrium."
2922,3.
2923,"Kidney impairment results in failed HCO3− regeneration 
and a metabolic acidosis."
2924,"B. Acidosis in patients with kidney disease may be of the anion 
gap type or nonanion gap type."
2925,1.
2926,"In early kidney disease, ammonia-genesis is impaired, 
resulting in reduced acid secretion and a nonanion gap 
metabolic acidosis."
2927,2.
2928,"In more advanced chronic kidney disease, the kidney 
remains unable to excrete the daily acid load and also 
becomes unable to excrete anions such as sulfates, 
phosphates, and urate."
2929,"Therefore, an anion gap acidosis 
develops."
2930,"HCO3− levels stabilize between 12 mEq/L and 
20 mEq/L."
2931,C. The acidosis has several adverse effects.
2932,1.
2933,"Increased calcium loss from bone
2."
2934,"Increased skeletal muscle breakdown
Treatment
A. NaHCO3− replacement
B. Hemodialysis
Alternative Diagnosis: Starvation Ketosis
Typically, starvation ketosis occurs in patients with diminished car -
bohydrate intake."
2935,"Ketosis is usually mild (HCO3− ≥ 14 mEq/L) 
and serum glucose is usually normal."
2936,Serum pH is usually normal.
2937,"Alternative Diagnosis: Alcoholic Ketoacidosis
Alcoholic ketoacidosis usually occurs in advanced alcoholism 
when the majority of calories come from alcohol."
2938,"Ketoacidosis 
develops due to the combined effects of inadequate carbohydrate 
intake, ethanol conversion to acetic acid and stimulated lipolysis."
2939,"Ketoacidosis may be precipitated by decreased intake, pancreatitis, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, or infection and may be profound."
2940,"The 
plasma glucose level is typically normal to low."
2941,"(Significant eleva -
tions suggest concomitant DKA.)"
2942,"It is important to consider other 
Stern_ch04_p055-p072.indd   63 25/07/19   5:14 pm64 / CHAPTER 4
causes of metabolic acidosis in alcoholic patients with acidosis."
2943,"First, patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis often have concomitant 
lactic acidosis."
2944,Shock and hypoxia should be carefully considered.
2945,"Lactic acidosis may also occur due to an increase in NADH levels 
and can be particularly severe in patients with thiamine deficiency."
2946,"Second, toxic ingestions (methanol, ethylene glycol, or salicy -
late) should also be considered, especially in patients with a large 
osmolar gap."
2947,"(The osmolar gap = measured serum osmolality – 
calculated serum osmolality."
2948,"The calculated osmolality = (2 × 
Na+) + Glucose (mg/dL)/18 + BUN (mg/dL)/2.8) + ETOH (mg/
dL)/3.7."
2949,A normal osmolar gap < 10 mOsm/kg.)
2950,"The treatment 
for alcoholic ketoacidosis should include IV thiamine prior to 
IV glucose to avoid precipitating Wernicke encephalopathy or 
Korsakoff syndrome."

Mr. L’s serum ketones are large."
2952,"He denies any history 
of heavy alcohol use or abuse."
2953,"The serum lactate level is 
1 mEq/L (nl 0.5–1.5 mEq/L)."
2954,"Step 5: Diagnose Primary Disorder
The high serum ketones confirm ketoacidosis as the primary meta -
bolic disturbance and the high glucose and diabetic history clearly 
suggest DKA as the cause of the primary acid-base abnormality."
2955,"The high glucose and profound acidosis are not consistent with 
starvation ketoacidosis and the absence of a significant alcohol 
history argues against alcoholic ketoacidosis."
2956,"The normal lactate 
effectively rules out lactic acidosis, and uremic acidosis is very 
unlikely with mild kidney disease (creatinine = 1.8)."
2957,"Step 6: Check for Additional Disorders
Step 6A: Check Anion Gap
Already completed (see above)Step 6B: Calculate Whether Compensation 
Is Appropriate
As shown in Table 4-4 the expected drop in PaCO2 to compensate for 
a metabolic acidosis is 1.2 mm Hg per 1 mEq/L fall in HCO3−."
2958,"The

Step 1: Determine Whether the Primary 
Disorder Is an Acidosis or Alkalosis by 
Reviewing the pH
Similar to the first case, Ms. S has a low serum HCO3− suggest -
ing a metabolic acidosis."
2994,"On the other hand, it is conceivable (but 
unlikely), that the low serum HCO3− could occur in compensation 
for a profound respiratory alkalosis."
2995,"An ABG can determine the 
primary disorder and assess compensation."
2996,"2
An ABG reveals a pH of 7.29, P aCO2 of 30 mm Hg, P aO2 of 
90 mm Hg."
2997,"The low pH on the ABG confirms the primary process is an 
acidosis."
2998,"Step 2: Determine Whether the Primary 
Acidosis or Alkalosis is Metabolic or 
Respiratory by Reviewing the HCO3−  
and PaCO2
Ms. S’s serum HCO3− is 14 mEq/L, her PaCO2 is 30 mm Hg."
2999,"Both 
are quite low but only the low HCO3− would create an acidosis."
3000,(A  low PaCO2 would drive the pH up and cause an alkalosis.)

metabolic acidosis."

The next step in the differential diagnosis is to calculate the anion 
gap."
3003,"Her anion gap = 138 − (102 + 14) = 22.Clearly, Ms. S is suffering from an anion gap metabolic acidosis."
3004,"This is alarming because metabolic acidosis in the face of infection 
suggests lactic acidosis due to severe sepsis."
3005,"Step 4: Explore the Differential Diagnoses 
of the Primary Disorder
The leading and must not miss hypothesis would clearly be lactic 
acidosis, especially given the patient’s hypotension."
3006,"If confirmed, 
the cause of the lactic acidosis must be determined (which would 
most likely be sepsis for Ms. S) and then treated."
3007,"Although unlikely, 
alternative causes of an anion gap metabolic acidosis (Table 4-1) 
that would be reasonable to consider include alcoholic ketoacidosis 
and toxin-related acidosis (including salicylates)."
3008,"The normal glu -
cose and lack of history of diabetes rules out DKA, and the severity 
of acidosis is not consistent with starvation ketoacidosis."
3009,"The nor -
mal creatinine rules out uremic acidosis."

for Ms. S is listed in Table 4-7."

3171,"The fall in systolic BP during inspiration is caused by 
an exaggerated inspiratory effort, which increases the 
negative inspiratory intrathoracic pressure and augments  
venous return."

the interventricular septum to bulge into the LV, limiting 
LV filling, LV cardiac output, and systolic BP ."

3178,"Supplemental oxygen should be given as necessary to prevent 
hypoxemia.Supplemental oxygen occasionally worsens 
hypercapnia in patients with severe COPD, 
asthma, or sleep apnea but should never be 
withheld from hypoxic patients."
3179,"C. Mechanical ventilation with either intubation or biphasic 
positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is lifesaving in many patients."
3180,1.
3181,"Institution of mechanical ventilation is considered when 
pH < 7.1–7.25 or PaCO2 > 80–90 mm Hg or when 
indicated by patient symptoms."
3182,2.
3183,"In general, patients with chronic hypoventilation tolerate 
hypercapnia better than patients with acute hypercapnia."
3184,"D. Avoid hypokalemia and dehydration that may worsen meta -
bolic alkalosis, raise the serum pH, and inadvertently further 
suppress ventilation."
3185,"Step 5: Diagnose Primary Disorder
The patient’s clinical picture and ABG clearly suggest the pri -
mary disorder is a respiratory acidosis."
3186,"However, to diagnose the 
primary disorder, it is critical to distinguish whether this is an 
acute or chronic respiratory acidosis."
3187,"Acute respiratory acidosis can 
be distinguished from chronic respiratory acidosis by evaluating 
the degree of metabolic compensation (provided there are no other 
acidoses also effecting HCO3−)."
3188,"Chronic respiratory acidoses are 
associated with more complete compensation (and higher HCO3− 
levels), than acute respiratory acidoses (because metabolic compen -
sation takes time)."
3189,"Table 4-4 shows the formulas that can be used 
to calculate the HCO3− levels."
3190,"In acute respiratory acidosis, the 
HCO3− increases by only 1 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg increase 
in PaCO2 whereas in chronic respiratory acidosis, the HCO3− 
increases by 4 mEq/L for every 10 mm Hg increase in PaCO2."
3191,"In 
Mr. R’s case, the PaCO2 is 70 mm Hg, up by 30 mm Hg (from a 
normal of 40 mm Hg), so if this were an acute respiratory acidosis,  
the HCO3− level would be expected to increase by only 3 mEq/L 
(from a normal of 24 mEq/L to 27 mEq/L)."
3192,"If, on the other hand, 
this is a chronic respiratory acidosis, an increase of 4 mEq/L of 
HCO3− per 10 mm Hg increase in PaCO2 would be expected."
3193,"For 
a 30 mm Hg increase in PaCO2, the predicted increase in HCO3− 
would be 3 × 4 = 12 mEq/L increasing the serum HCO3− to 36 
(24 + 12 mEq/L)."
3194,"Since Mr. R.’s HCO3− is 27 mEq/L, an increase 
of only 3 mEq/L from a normal baseline of 24 mEq/L, the primary 
disorder is an acute  respiratory acidosis, an alarming diagnosis."
3195,"Step 6: Check for Additional Disorders
Step 6A: Calculate Anion Gap (Even in Patients 
Without Acidosis) to Uncover Unexpected 
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis
Another “must not miss” diagnosis for Mr. R would be sepsis."
3196,"His symptoms of fever and cough suggest the possibility of 
pneumonia, which can be complicated by sepsis resulting in an 
anion gap metabolic lactic acidosis."
3197,"Although his elevated HCO3− 
does not immediately suggest a metabolic acidosis from sepsis, 
Stern_ch04_p055-p072.indd   69 25/07/19   5:14 pm70 / CHAPTER 4
the HCO3− may not be low if there is also a superimposed met -
abolic alkalosis generating HCO3−."
3198,"These hidden acidoses can 
be discovered by evaluating the anion gap (which is usually ele -
vated in patients with lactic acidosis) or by measuring the serum 
lactate level."
3199,"3
The anion gap = 138 − (102 + 27) = 9, and the serum 
lactate level is 0.8 mEq/L (nl 0.5–1.5 mEq/L)."
3200,"Mr. R has a normal anion gap and normal lactate level, ruling 
out a coexistent hidden anion gap metabolic acidosis from sepsis."
3201,"3
Mr. R’s other laboratory results include a WBC, 16,500/mcL  
with 62% granulocytes and 10% bands."
3202,"Chest radio -
graph reveals hyperinflated lung fields and a left lower lobe 
infiltrate."
3203,"Step 7: Reach Final Diagnosis
As noted above, the minimal metabolic compensation suggests that 
Mr. R is suffering from an acute  respiratory acidosis with meta -
bolic compensation."
3204,"There is no evidence of a hidden anion gap 
acidosis."
3205,"Therefore, Mr. R has an acute respiratory acidosis caused 
by pneumonia and COPD."
3206,"He is at significant risk for complete 
respiratory failure and he is transferred to the ICU."
3207,"It is vital to distinguish acute from chronic 
respiratory acidoses."
3208,"CASE RESOLUTION
3
In the ICU, Mr. R is placed on ventilatory support with 
BiPAP and antibiotics."
3209,"Over the next 5 days, his pneumonia 
improves."
3210,"On day 8, BiPAP is discontinued and he is sent to 
the medical floors."

ease, a mild nonanion gap acidosis (HCO3− ≈ 17 mEq/L) and 
hyperkalemia."

3215,Patients with type IV RTA have hypoaldosteronism.
3216,"B. Hypoaldosteronism decreases potassium and H+ excretion,

3217,"The hyperkalemia also interferes with ammonia production 
(the major renal buffer) and further impairs acid secretion."

3228,"Muscle cramping 
due to coexistent hypokalemia may be seen."
3229,"Disease Highlights
A. Metabolic alkalosis develops only when there is both a source 
of additional HCO3− and a renal stimulus that limits its 
excretion."
3230,1.

3232,"Volume contraction around a constant amount 
of HCO3− also serves to increase the HCO3−."

Mixed Disorders and the “Delta-Delta Gap”
A."
3287,"Occasionally, 2 distinct metabolic processes will be present 
in the same patient (eg, 2 distinct acidoses, 1 anion gap 
and 1 nonanion gap)."
3288,"Alternatively, a patient may have 
both a metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis (eg, 
metabolic alkalosis develops in a patient with vomiting and 
dehydration; if these symptoms are prolonged sufficiently, 
severe dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and lactic acidosis 
also develop)."
3289,B.
3290,"These multiple metabolic processes can be difficult to tease 
out."
3291,"C. One approach to this problem is to evaluate the delta-delta 
gap."
3292,"Here the relative rise in the anion gap over and above 
the normal anion gap, (ΔAG, the first delta) is compared 
with the absolute fall in HCO3− (ΔHCO3−, the second 
delta2)."
3293,1.
3294,"In simple anion gap acidoses, the deltas are similar 
(as patients create extra anions (ie, ketones) increasing 
the anion gap, the serum HCO3− is neutralized in equal 
proportions)."
3295,2.
3296,"On the other hand, in a patient with both an anion gap 
and nonanion gap acidoses, the fall in HCO3− will be 
greater than the rise in the anion gap."
3297,3.
3298,"In patients with an anion gap acidosis and a metabolic 
alkalosis, the fall in HCO3− will be antagonized by the 
concomitant metabolic alkalosis whereas the anions will 
still accumulate."
3299,"Therefore, the fall in HCO3− is less than 
the increase in the anion gap."
3300,"D. While occasionally useful, there are several limitations to 
applying the delta-delta gap."
3301,1.
3302,"The normal anion gap varies from institution to institution 
and with the patient’s serum albumin."
3303,2.
3304,"Even in simple anion gap acidosis, bone buffering of acid 
and renal excretion of anions complicate the delta-delta gap 
and make it difficult to interpret."
3305,"E. In simple anion gap acidosis (without concomitant metabolic 
alkalosis or nonanion gap acidosis) the typical ΔAG/ΔHCO3− 
is 1.6:1 in lactic acidosis and 1:1 in ketoacidosis.REFERENCES

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Mr. A asks his new primary care clinician whether he should 
get an HIV test."
3382,"He states that he has “absolutely no risk 
factors for HIV,” and is a very healthy 21-year-old black 
man in a monogamous relationship with his girlfriend for 
2  years."
3383,"The girlfriend was tested for HIV 6 months ago 
when a Board of Health nurse notified her that she might 
have been exposed to HIV, and retested 3 months ago."
3384,"Both 
HIV tests were negative, effectively ruling out HIV infection."
3385,Mr. A first became sexually active at age 15.
3386,"Over the 
last 6 years, he has had 4 female partners, with a bit of 
overlap between the relationships (he had 2 simultane -
ous partners for about 1 year)."
3387,"He has never had sex with 
a male."
3388,"He uses condoms “pretty consistently.” He had 
Chlamydia trachomatis  urethritis 3 years ago, but no other 
sexually transmitted infections."
3389,"He has never used injecting 
drugs, although he smokes marijuana once or twice a week."
3390,"He stopped drinking excessively when he met his current 
girlfriend."
3391,"He does not recall an episode of mononucleosis-
like illness with fever and lymph node enlargement."
3392,"His past 
medical history, review of systems, and physical exam are 
otherwise unremarkable."

patients are entirely asymptomatic in spite of long-standing HIV 
infection and advanced immune deficiency as demonstrated by an

3397,"Some patients may have symptoms that are 
often seen with HIV but are nonspecific, such as chronic diarrhea, 
seborrheic dermatitis, multiple molluscum contagiosum, poorly 
responsive psoriasis, and prurigo nodularis."
3398,"Other patients have 
conditions that are strongly associated with HIV infection but are 
also encountered in non–HIV-infected persons, such as tuberculosis 
(TB), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, nephropathy, nonis -
chemic cardiomyopathy, herpes zoster (shingles), and non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma."
3399,"Unfortunately, patients may be found to have HIV only when they are admitted to the hospital with a life-threatening 
AIDS-defining condition, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia 
(PJP), Cryptococcus neoformans  meningitis, central nervous system 
(CNS) toxoplasmosis, or primary CNS lymphoma (PCL)."

viral load.I have patients with AIDS-related complaints."

asks about HIV screening."

(3) Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) results 
in a very low viral load, decreasing the risk of 
transmission by at least 95%."
3427,"c. Sexual practices and sexually transmitted infections
(1) The highest risk of sexual transmission is among 
men with unprotected receptive anal intercourse 
and individuals with multiple sexual partners."
3428,"(2) The presence of genital inflammation or breakdown 
of genital mucosa increases the risk of transmission."
3429,"Receptive anal intercourse is frequently associated 
with trauma as well as an increased risk of sexually 
transmitted infections."
3430,"(3) Sexually transmitted infections, whether they cause 
genital ulceration or not, significantly increase the 
risk of either transmitting or acquiring HIV."
3431,"(4) The risk is greater for persons with simultaneous 
rather than consecutive partners."
3432,"(5) During heterosexual intercourse, man-to-woman 
transmission is significantly more likely than 
woman-to-man transmission."
3433,"(6) Circumcised males are 65% less likely to acquire HIV 
through heterosexual intercourse, but circumcision 
does not reduce male-to-male sexual transmission."
3434,"(7) The consistent use of barrier methods (either male 
or female condoms) is about 95% effective in 
preventing HIV sexual transmission, but adherence 
is poor in most high-risk situations."
3435,"d. T ransmission through blood transfusion has been 
nearly eliminated by blood product screening."
3436,"The risk 
associated with blood transfusion in the United States is 
estimated at < 1 in 1,800,000 units."
3437,"e. Mother-to-child-transmission is common without ART 
prophylaxis."
3438,"Effective therapy markedly reduces this risk 
(see below)."
3439,"B. HIV and its target, the CD4TL
1."
3440,The main target cell of HIV is the CD4TL.
3441,"The HIV 
surface protein GP 120 binds first to the main HIV 
receptor, the CD4 receptor."
3442,"Second, the surface protein 
binds to an HIV chemokine co-receptor, either CCR5 or 
CXCR4."
3443,"HIV also infects secondary target cells that carry 
these receptors, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and 
stem cells."
3444,2.
3445,"HIV replicates mostly in activated CD4TL: 99% of 
HIV detected in the blood comes from recently infected, 
activated CD4TL."
3446,3.
3447,"In acute HIV infection, there is a very rapid decrease in the 
number of CD4TL in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues 
but only a moderate and partially reversible decrease in the 
blood CD4TL."
3448,4.
3449,"In chronic HIV infection, the absolute CD4TL count 
decreases slowly in the blood."
3450,"About 2 billion CD4TL are 
destroyed and replaced every day."
3451,"Both HIV-infected and 
noninfected CD4TL (innocent bystanders) are destroyed."
3452,5.
3453,"In most infected individuals, the high rate of CD4TL death 
results in a progressive fall in the blood CD4TL."
3454,6.
3455,"When the absolute CD4TL count falls below 200 cells/mcL, 
immunologic AIDS is diagnosed."
3456,a.
3457,"The patient is susceptible to virulent pathogens, 
opportunistic infections (OIs), and AIDS-defining 
malignancies."
3458,"The lower the CD4TL count, the greater the 
risk of any OI and the greater the spectrum of OIs seen.b."
3459,"Some patients acquire an OI (such as TB) or AIDS-
defining malignancy (such as lymphoma) at a CD4TL 
higher than 200 cells/mcL; in these cases clinical AIDS 
is diagnosed."
3460,7.
3461,"About 5% of patients have stable CD4TL over many years 
(“long-term nonprogressors”)."
3462,"Rarely, the viral load is also 
undetectable (“elite controllers”)."
3463,8.
3464,"Accelerated evolution of HIV and quasi-species
a. HIV evolves rapidly due to both a high rate of mutations 
introduced by an error-prone reverse transcriptase 
and a very high replication rate (10 billion new HIV 
virions per day)."
3465,"This allows for the rapid development 
of genetic variants (quasi-species), which may escape 
immune responses and become resistant to a number of 
antiretroviral agents."
3466,b.
3467,"Effective ART requires complete suppression of viral 
replication to prevent new cell infections and the 
production of mutations associated with drug resistance."
3468,"C. Staging
1."
3469,"Stages of HIV infection include viral transmission, primary 
infection, seroconversion, clinically latent period, early 
symptomatic HIV infection, and AIDS."
3470,a.
3471,"Primary HIV infection
(1) Most patients with primary HIV infection 
are symptomatic: many have nonspecific 
symptoms like fever, diarrhea, arthralgia, 
headache, or flu-like symptoms."
3472,"Some present 
with a striking mononucleosis syndrome that 
includes fever, sore throat, rash, oral aphthous 
ulcers, and lymphadenopathy."
3473,"Occasionally, 
they have neurologic complications, such as 
aseptic meningitis, acute encephalopathy, or 
Guillain-Barré syndrome."
3474,"Acute HIV infection should be considered 
in patients with mononucleosis syndromes 
when tests are negative for  Epstein-Barr virus 
(negative EBV viral capsid IgM) and cytomeg -
alovirus (negative CMV IgM)."
3475,"Diagnosis of 
acute HIV requires a high index of suspicion."
3476,"(2) In primary HIV infection, the HIV viral load 
is almost always > 10,000/mcL and usually 
> 100,000/mcL."
3477,"Therefore, a low-positive viral 
load in this context should be repeated to rule 
out a false-positive test."
3478,"b. Seroconversion
(1) Seroconversion rapidly causes a fall in HIV viral 
load (due to both humoral and cellular immune 
responses)."
3479,"(2) After about 6 months, the viral load is set at a level 
that remains relatively stable in any specific patient 
(the viral load “set point”) but varies from patient to 
patient."
3480,"(3) In the absence of ART, the set point predicts the 
rate of disease progression (higher viral loads are 
associated with more rapid declines in CD4TL 
counts)."
3481,"c. Clinically latent period
(1) Following primary infection, viral replication 
continues primarily within activated CD4TL, with 
progressive destruction of the CD4TL pool."
3482,"Stern_ch05_p073-p104.indd   74 11/07/19   4:56 pmAIDS/HIV INFECTION  / 75
(2) Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy is often seen."
3483,"(3) Progression to an AIDS-defining illness is more 
common in patients with higher viral loads and 
lower CD4TL counts."
3484,"(4) Progressive depletion of CD4TL renders patients 
increasingly susceptible to OIs and malignancies: 
AIDS is predominantly a T-cell immunodeficiency."
3485,"However, multiple other immune responses are 
abnormal: for example, HIV-infected patients often 
have polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and fail 
to mount antibody responses to either Streptococcus 
pneumoniae  infection or the administration of the 
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine."
3486,"d. Early symptomatic HIV infection: At relatively high 
CD4TL counts (200–350 cells/mcL) HIV infection is 
associated with an increased risk of infections by virulent 
pathogens, especially pneumococcal pneumonia and TB."
3487,"e. AIDS
(1) Advanced HIV disease is accompanied by 
severe CD4TL depletion (below 200 cells/mcL) 
and infection with less virulent, opportunistic 
pathogens."
3488,"(2) Specific opportunistic pathogens are mostly 
encountered when the CD4TL count falls below a 
critical level."
3489,"(a) CD4TL count < 200 cells/mcL: PJP , oral 
candidiasis
(b) CD4TL count < 100 cells/mcL: 
Toxoplasma gondii  brain abscesses, Candida  
esophagitis, C neoformans  meningitis, 
disseminated histoplasmosis, and meningeal 
coccidioidomycosis
(c) CD4TL count < 50 cells/mcL: Cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) retinitis and Mycobacterium avium / 
intracellulare  (MAI); the latter is also called 
disseminated M avium  complex (MAC)
(3) AIDS diagnostic criteria
(a) CD4TL count < 200 cells/mcL (immunologic 
AIDS)
(b) AIDS indicator conditions (clinical AIDS):
(i) AIDS-defining malignancies: PCL, non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and 
invasive cervical cancer
(ii) OIs: PJP , TB, disseminated MAC, recurrent 
bacterial pneumonia, esophageal candidiasis, 
cryptococcosis, progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), toxoplasmosis, 
and cryptosporidiosis
(iii) Other AIDS indicator conditions: HIV-
associated dementia and AIDS wasting 
syndrome (“slim disease”)
(c) Advanced HIV infection is defined as CD4TL 
count < 50 cells/mcL."
3490,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
Similar to any other diagnosis, the positive predictive value is 
determined by 3 features: the pretest probability of disease, the 
sensitivity of the test, and the specificity of the test."
3491,"Each feature 
must be carefully evaluated to interpret HIV results properly."
3492,"A. Estimating pretest probability of HIV infection
1."
3493,"Risk factors include MSM, IDU, and multiple sexual partners."
3494,2.
3495,"The prevalence of HIV varies from 0.3% in the general US 
population to > 50% in very high-risk groups.B."
3496,"Diagnosis of HIV: the 3-step HIV screening sequence
1."
3497,"The diagnosis of HIV infection utilizes antibodies to HIV 
and tests for HIV RNA and HIV p24 antigen."
3498,"a. HIV RNA and p24 antigen are present prior to HIV 
antibodies and allow for the diagnosis of early HIV 
infection prior to the presence of HIV antibodies 
(Figure 5-1)."
3499,b.
3500,"The CDC has recently recommended a 3-step HIV 
screening sequence to improve the sensitivity of early 
HIV diagnosis without increasing the rate of false-
positive diagnosis (Figure 5-2)."
3501,"(1) The first step is the fourth-generation HIV-1/2 
antigen/antibody combination immunoassay: it 
detects both HIV 1/2 antibody (Ab) and HIV-1 
p 24 antigen (Ag)."
3502,"Adding the p24 Ag to this test 
allows for recognition of early HIV infection before 
Ab is detectable."
3503,"(2) When the first step is positive, the second step of 
the sequence is the HIV-1/HIV-2 Ab differentiation 
immunoassay."
3504,"This confirmatory test detects and 
differentiates Ab to HIV-1 and to HIV-2."
3505,"The 
result is reported as HIV-1 Ab detected, HIV-2 Ab 
detected, non-differentiated HIV Ab detected, or 
no Ab detected."
3506,"(3) When the result of the second step does not confirm 
HIV (HIV-1 Ab is negative or indeterminate and 
HIV-2 Ab is negative), a third step is required, 
which is an HIV-1 nucleic acid test, usually the 
HIV-1 quantitative RNA viral load."
3507,"A positive 
HIV-1 RNA viral load confirms HIV-1 infection."
3508,"A negative HIV-1 RNA viral load rules out HIV 
infection."
3509,"(4) In summary, HIV-1 infection is only confirmed 
when 2 steps of the HIV screening sequence are 
positive."
3510,2.
3511,"Specificity and sensitivity of the 3-step HIV sequence
a."
3512,"When both the first and either the second or the 
third tests are positive, the sensitivity > 99% and the 
specificity of the 2-step test is about 99.6%."
3513,b.
3514,"Very recent HIV infection prior to the appearance of 
p24 Ag will be negative on the HIV screening sequence."
3515,"Because p24 Ag appears around 14 days after infection, 
only few primary cases of HIV are missed."
3516,"Still, these 
patients may have poor outcomes and cause further 
HIV infections."
3517,"Prevention and Treatment
A."
3518,"Prevention
1."
3519,"As noted above, male and female condoms are about 
95% effective in preventing HIV sexual transmission, but 
adherence is poor in many high-risk situations."
3520,2.
3521,"Blood product screening has virtually eliminated transfusion-
associated HIV transmission in the United States."
3522,3.
3523,"Effective ART results in a very low viral load, decreasing 
the risk of transmission by about 95%."
3524,"The “treatment as 
prevention” strategy aims to identify HIV infection early 
and start effective therapy, reducing the spread of HIV."
3525,4.
3526,"Preexposure prophylaxis (PreP)
a."

3545,"Most cases occur at term (intrapartum) and with 
breastfeeding, but there is a significant risk during 
pregnancy."
3546,"b. HIV-infected pregnant women are treated as soon as 
possible with ART so the viral load is undetectable 
during pregnancy and at the time of delivery."
3547,"c. Postpartum, mothers are told not to breastfeed and the 
neonates receive postexposure ART prophylaxis."
3548,"d. Women who do not reach a low viral load at 
term (viral load < 1000 copies/mL) are offered 
an elective cesarean section to decrease the risk of 
mother-to-child-transmission."
3549,"e. Intravenous zidovudine is given during labor if there is 
no documentation of an undetectable viral load."
3550,"f. This strategy has reduced mother-to-child-transmission 
by more than 90% in the United States."

3552,"Universal screening
1."
3553,"More than 1 million people live with HIV in the 
United States, and 14% of them are unaware of their 
infection, which contributes to further spread of HIV."
3554,2.
3555,"In the absence of screening, many patients present with 
advanced immunodeficiency and OIs."
3556,a.
3557,"Such patients are often very ill and severely immuno-
compromised, and are at high risk for poor outcome."
3558,b.
3559,"Even if they do well on ART, most only partially recover 
their immune function."
3560,3.
3561,"Selective high-risk screening is inefficient
a."
3562,"Although most HIV-infected patients have increased 
risk factors, clinicians do not consistently ask about risk 
factors and may not even consistently screen patients 
who present with another sexually transmitted or blood 
borne infection (“missed opportunities” for HIV testing)."
3563,b.
3564,"Patients may not report risk factors accurately especially 
if they fear the clinician may be judgmental."
3565,"c. Not all HIV-infected patients have identifiable risk 
factors, especially if HIV prevalence is higher in the 
general population."
3566,"d. Therefore, selective HIV screening of high-risk 
individuals is very inefficient."
3567,4.
3568,"Universal HIV screening recommended
a. CDC recommends routine HIV screening for patients 
aged 13–64 years evaluated in all healthcare settings 
unless the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection had 
been documented to be below 0.1%."

clinician/patient relationship."
3575,b.
3576,"Patients who have just found out they have HIV tend to 
be distraught and confused even if they are not totally 
surprised by the diagnosis."
3577,"c. Often patients do not believe that the diagnosis is 
correct (HIV denial)."
3578,"d. Patients may believe wrongly that their life is over 
because they perceive that they will die soon from HIV, 
will be unable to live a productive and fulfilling life, will 
face severe drug adverse effects, or might infect their 
household contacts."
3579,"Such misconceptions also enhance 
the stigma associated with HIV."
3580,"e. The primary care clinician should take the required 
time necessary to reassure the patient that HIV can be 
managed well on a simple ART regimen with acceptable 
side effects in most people, and clarify the diagnosis, 
transmission, and natural history."
3581,"f. Providing ample time to answer questions and deal 
with anxiety, depression, addiction, housing issues, 
healthcare insurance coverage, and partner notification 
is important."
3582,"g. Referral to an infectious disease specialist (or internist 
with specialized HIV practice) is required, but the 
primary care clinician should strongly consider 
continuing to provide primary care to his or her 
HIV-infected patients."
3583,2.
3584,"The role of the HIV specialist
a."
3585,"The HIV specialist works with nurses, social workers, 
case managers, HIV support groups, AIDS legal support 
groups, addiction specialists, and psychiatrists to ensure 
effective HIV care and maximize adherence to ART."
3586,"b. HIV-infected patients who adhere to ART are highly 
likely to achieve an undetectable HIV viral load and do 
well over many years."

3598,"(ii) Second, the test is not specific: false positive 
PPD frequently occurs due to prior exposure 
to nontuberculous mycobacteria or prior 
administration of Bacille Calmette-Guerin 
(BCG)."
3599,"(iii) Third, PPD can be falsely negative when 
a patient infected with HIV is unable to 
mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity 
response, usually due to a low CD4 count."
3600,"(b) An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is 
frequently preferred to PPD in HIV patients."
3601,"(i) First, IGRA is much more specific for 
latent TB infection and is not affected 
by prior BCG vaccination, although it 
can be positive with prior exposure to 
Mycobacterium kansasii  or Mycobacterium 
marinum ."
3602,"(ii) Second, when the patient is unable 
to mount an immune response to the 
M tuberculosis  Ag included, IGRA will be 
indeterminate rather than negative."
3603,"An 
indeterminate IGRA test is inconclusive and 
does not increase the probability of TB or 
latent TB infection."
3604,"A positive PPD or IGRA never proves active 
TB, and a negative PPD or IGRA never rules 
out active TB."

conjugated vaccines is better so the tetanus/diphtheria/
acellular pertussis (TDAP) vaccine and the 13-valent 
conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar 13) are 
likely to be effective even at lower CD4 count."
3609,b.

reconstitution, delaying or repeating immunizations 
may be useful."

3616,b.
3617,"Effective ART requires complete suppression of viral 
replication to prevent the emergence of mutations 
associated with drug resistance."
3618,"c. The cornerstone of therapy is the simultaneous  and 
uninterrupted  use of generally 3 antiretroviral drugs to 
which the virus is susceptible."
3619,"A fourth drug may be 
added to boost the level of one of the active drugs."
3620,"Often, 
it is possible to select a combination tablet that includes 
all required drugs, allowing a 1 pill once a day regimen."
3621,"d. Complete suppression is realistic in most patients, 
prevents the worsening of immune deficiency and 
results in at least partial immune reconstitution."

due to non-replicating, latent HIV in the reservoirs 
(including macrophages, resting CD4TL, memory cells 
and stem cells).f."
3623,"Even in patients with a so-called “undetectable viral 
load,” there is a “residual HIV viremia” (1–5 copies/mL), 
which can only be assessed with advanced research 
techniques."
3624,"When ART is interrupted, the residual 
viremia re-infects activated CD4TL, leading to a relapse."
3625,HIV is not curable with ART alone.
3626,"Lifelong ART is required for all HIV infected 
persons  
g. Indications for ART
(1) ART is indicated all HIV-infected patients, 
including those with acute HIV infection and 
chronic symptomatic or asymptomatic infection
(2) With OIs that involve the brain, ART is delayed 
to prevent immune-reconstitution-inflammatory 
syndrome (IRIS) and cerebral edema associated

control and prevent resistance."
3643,"(3) High adherence has been shown to decrease 
morbidity and mortality."
3644,"(4) Moderately poor adherence (50–90%) still has 
still significant clinical benefits but promotes viral 
resistance, leading to eventual failure of therapy."
3645,"(5) Very poor adherence (below 50%) does not prevent 
progression to AIDS (nor select for resistance)."
3646,"(6) Predictors of poor adherence include substance 
abuse, mental illness, lack of access to medical care 
or medications, lack of patient education, and poor 
trust between patient and clinician."

3648,"Testing for viral resistance
(1) Performed at baseline to detect transmitted 
resistance and whenever the patient fails to achieve

(2) Both genotype and phenotype are available, but 
the genotype is preferred because it provides faster 
results, costs less, and is as clinically useful as the

3674,"A second goal of treatment is to achieve the UNAIDS 
90-90-90% targets: by 2020, 90% of the HIV-positive 
population diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed individuals 
on ART, and 90% of patients on ART virologically 
suppressed."
3675,"Currently in the United States, of all 
persons infected with HIV, 86% are diagnosed, 63% 
are in care, 49% are retained in care, and 51% have a 
suppressed viral load (Figure 5-3)."

As noted above, 3 factors determine the positive predictive value of 
the test: the pretest probability, the sensitivity, and the specificity."
3678,Mr. A is asymptomatic and denies high-risk behaviors.
3679,"However, 
he may not truly be at a low risk of HIV, since he had a prior sex -
ually transmitted infection and did not always  use a condom with 
his 4 sex partners."
3680,"His history of alcohol binges may also point to 
forgotten prior high-risk behaviors."
3681,"The history of simultaneous 
sexual partners is also a risk factor."
3682,"His pretest probability of HIV 
infection is therefore significantly higher than he believes."
3683,"1
A fourth-generation HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combination 
immunoassay is positive."
3684,"The HIV-1/HIV-2 Ab differentia -
tion immunoassay confirmatory test detects HIV-1 Ab, 
confirming HIV-1 infection."
3685,"Because of the excellent spec -
ificity of the combined tests, his posttest probability of 
HIV infection is > 99%."
3686,"The CD4TL count is 150 cells/mcL

negative.Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, HIV?"
3689,"Are other tests 
needed to exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
3690,"CASE RESOLUTION
Mr. A is infected with HIV-1 and his CD4TL count is diagnostic 
of immunologic AIDS."
3691,"At this point, primary prophylaxis with 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is indicated to pre -
vent PJP because the CD4TL count is < 200 cells/mcL."
3692,"Prophy -
laxis for toxoplasmosis is not necessary since he is seronegative for 
T gondii ."
3693,He does not need isoniazid since his IGRA is negative.
3694,"The patient should undergo blood testing for CBC with plate -
lets, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, HBsAg, HBsAb, 
HBc total Ab, HCV Ab with reflex HCV viral load, G6PD level, 
and syphilis testing (using the reverse sequence syphilis algo -
rithm)."
3695,"Urine nucleic acid test for Chlamydia  and N gonorrhoeae  
is recommended."
3696,"He should receive the influenza vaccine as well 
as two conjugate vaccines: TDAP and the conjugated 13-valent 
pneumococcal vaccine (Prenar-13), which are both highly 
immunogenic."
3697,"T wo months later he can receive the polysaccha -
ride 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax  23), but it 
is best to wait until the CD4 has increased > 200 cells/mcL to 
improve immunogenicity."
3698,"Hepatitis B and hepatitis A combined 
vaccine series should also be offered after the CD4 has increased 
above 200 cells/mcL."
3699,"He is in a monogamous sexual relationship with an HIV sero -
negative, uninfected female partner."
3700,"To decrease her risk of acquiring 
HIV, they should use barrier precautions (male or female condoms 
are 95% effective), and he should start ART to lower his HIV viral 
load to below the level of detection (treatment as prevention > 95% 
effective)."
3701,"If he is adherent to ART and his viral load is kept below 
20 copies/mL, there is virtually no risk of transmission ."
3702,"However, the 
use of barrier precautions is a safety feature in case he developed a 
detectable viral load due to imperfect adherence to ART."
3703,"Another 
approach if barrier precautions are not acceptable or adhered to is 
to provide preexposure prophylaxis with the combination of teno -
fovir disoproxyl fumarate and emtricitabine daily to his girlfriend."
3704,"The tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine combination is not yet 
approved for preexposure prophylaxis but the DISCOVER trial is

CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Three pivotal considerations help frame the differential diagnosis 
in HIV-infected persons with neurologic complaints: (1) the acuity 
of the symptoms, (2) the degree of immunosuppression (CD4TL), 
and (3) whether the patient has focal neurologic signs and/or a 
focal abnormality on neuroimaging."
3720,"The first pivotal step in evaluating the HIV-positive patient 
with headache is to determine the acuity  of the presentation."
3721,"Most 
OIs have a subacute onset."
3722,"In HIV-infected patients with an acute 
onset of headache and fever (< 3 days), virulent pathogens must 
be considered including bacterial meningitis and viral encephalitis, 
most commonly herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1) and West Nile virus 
encephalitis."
3723,"The second pivotal issue is to assess the degree of immunosup -
pression ."
3724,"HIV-positive patients with intact immunity and CD4TL 
> 200 cells/mcL are at markedly diminished risk of OIs."
3725,"The 
differential diagnosis of such headaches is therefore similar to 
patients without HIV infection; however, HIV itself can cause 
aseptic meningitis or encephalopathy in acute HIV with high viral 
loads."
3726,"As the immunosuppression worsens and the CD4TL falls 
<  200 cells/mcL, the differential diagnosis broadens to include 
OIs and PCL."
3727,"The third pivotal issue is to determine whether or not the 
patient has focal neurologic signs typically associated with a 
focal abnormality on neuroimaging ( mass lesion  or focal white 
matter disease )."
3728,"The most common diagnoses in HIV-infected 
patients with low CD4TL who have focal neurologic signs or 
mass lesions on neuroimaging  are toxoplasmosis and PCL, as 
well as PML (plaques of demyelination)."
3729,"The most common 
diagnoses in HIV-infected patients with low CD4TL who have 
a nonfocal neurologic presentation and without focal findings 
on neuroimaging are cryptococcal meningitis, other fungal 
meningitis (coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis), TB men -
ingitis, and syphilis."
3730,"Both CNS imaging (CT and MRI) and 
lumbar puncture (LP) are frequently required to confirm the 
diagnosis."
3731,"In clinical practice, a CT scan is usually performed 
prior to LP because it rapidly rules out a large mass lesion that 
may cause post LP herniation."
3732,"Platelet count, prothrombin 
time, and partial thromboplastin time should be checked to 
ensure the patient is not at an increased risk for developing 
a spinal epidural hemorrhage from the LP ."
3733,"An MRI is often 
performed subsequently due to its substantially increased sen -
sitivity for several diagnoses."

The first pivotal consideration is that Mr. S has had a headache 
for 2 weeks (subacute)."
3767,"This suggests a relatively less virulent OI 
rather than a virulent bacterial meningitis or HSV-1 encephalitis."
3768,"Second, his prior CD4TL indicates profound immunosup -
pression."
3769,"Therefore, he is at risk for all the serious OIs listed 
above."
3770,The third pivotal issue is whether there is a mass lesion.
3771,"Ultimately, this will be confirmed or excluded on neuroimaging, 
but his photophobia suggests some form of meningoencephalitis."
3772,"Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common meningitis seen 
in AIDS and is the leading hypothesis."
3773,"Less common causes of 
meningoencephalitis include neurosyphilis, TB meningitis, and 
other fungal meningitis (coccidioidomycosis in the southwest -
ern United States, and histoplasmosis and blastomycosis in the 
Midwest)."
3774,HIV aseptic meningitis may present with headache.
3775,"Should neuroimaging confirm a focal abnormality, common 
causes include toxoplasmosis, PML, and PCL."
3776,"Since Mr. S has 
not taken TMP-SMX prophylaxis, he is at increased risk for toxo -
plasmosis, the most common CNS mass lesion in AIDS patients."
3777,"Finally, given his history of IDU, he is also at risk for a brain 
abscess secondary to Staphylococcus aureus."

Mr. L is a 35-year-old man who is HIV-positive."

complaints are cough and fever lasting for 4 days."
4198,"What is the differential diagnosis of cough 
and fever in HIV-positive patients?"
4199,"How would 
you frame the differential?"
4200,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The most common pneumonias in HIV-infected patients are 
bacterial pneumonia, PJP , and pulmonary TB."
4201,"Taken together, 
they account for 91% of pulmonary infections in HIV-positive 
patients."
4202,"Three pivotal features aid in the diagnosis of these com -
mon pneumonias in HIV-infected persons."
4203,"First, the CD4TL 
count gauges the level of immunocompromise."
4204,"Virulent infec -
tions, such as pulmonary TB or bacterial pneumonia, may occur 
in patients with any CD4TL count."
4205,"On the other hand, less viru -
lent infections, such as PJP , are seen almost exclusively in patients 
with CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL."
4206,"The second pivotal feature is that certain diseases present acutely 
(bacterial pneumonia), but other diseases present subacutely or 
chronically (pulmonary TB or PJP)."
4207,"The final pivotal feature that aids in the diagnosis of these com -
plaints is the pattern on chest radiograph."
4208,"Lobar infiltrates suggest 
bacterial pneumonia, whereas diffuse or interstitial infiltrates are seen in PJP and TB."
4209,"Patterns that suggest pulmonary TB include 
apical or cavitary infiltrates (if CD4TL > 200 cells/mcL), hilar 
lymphadenopathy, or nodular infiltrates."
4210,"The chest radiographic 
pattern in pulmonary TB varies depending on the patient’s degree 
of immunosuppression."
4211,"Table 5-4 summarizes the typical CD4TL 
count, acuity, and chest radiographic pattern and approach to 
pulmonary infection in HIV-positive patients."
4212,T umors may also cause pulmonary complaints.
4213,"Not surpris -
ingly, aggressive neoplasms, such as lung cancer, may occur at any 
CD4TL count, whereas pulmonary lymphoma usually develops in 
patients with CD4TL counts < 500 cells/mcL, and Kaposi sarcoma 
usually develops in patients with CD4TL < 200 cells/mcL."
4214,"As noted above, the most common pneumonias in HIV-infected 
patients are bacterial pneumonia, PJP and pulmonary TB."
4215,"PJP is 
reviewed in Chapter 10 and will be mentioned here only briefly."
4216,"There are a large number of less common causes of pneumonia 
in HIV-infected patients that will not be reviewed here including 
endemic or geographically limited fungi (blastomycosis, coccid -
ioidomycosis, and histoplasmosis), opportunistic fungi (crypto -
coccosis and, in late AIDS, aspergillosis), uncommon bacterial 
pathogens ( Nocardia , Rhodococcus equi , M kanasii ) and CMV."

4256,"Given this

There are 2 key features to Mr. L ’s presentation."
4257,"The first pivotal 
feature is that his CD4TL count is only moderately reduced."
4258,"This makes a variety of OIs unlikely (PJP , MAI, CMV, and 
cryptococcosis)."
4259,"On the other hand, pulmonary TB, bacte -
rial pneumonia, and blastomycosis are sufficiently virulent to 
present in patients with normal or mildly impaired immune sys -
tems."
4260,"The second pivotal feature is the rapid development of the 
pulmonary process, which strongly favors bacterial pneumonia 
over pulmonary TB."
4261,"The differential diagnosis is summarized 
in Table 5-5."
4262,"PATIENT  3
Physical exam reveals temperature, 38.6°C; BP , 120/75 mm 
Hg; HR, 110 bpm; RR, 18 breaths per minute."

monthly liver biochemical tests to rule out isoniazid-
induced hepatitis."
4528,"All HIV-infected patients are at 
higher risk for hepatotoxicity (NASH, drug adverse 
effects) and should receive monthly liver biochemical 
tests."

4530,"Rifampin prophylaxis for 4 months is an alternative when 
isoniazid cannot be used or to shorten the duration of 
prophylaxis; however, drug interactions have to be carefully 
reviewed."
4531,"Adverse effects include hepatitis, blood dyscrasias, 
rash, and hypersensitivity."
4532,7.

4541,"T reating TB in HIV is complicated by clinically 
important drug interactions; consultation is 
recommended."
4542,"Rifampin is rarely used in HIV-
infected patients in the United States because rifabutin 
interactions are easier to manage."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Mrs. A is a 48-year-old white woman who has had fatigue 
for 2 months due to anemia."
4775,What is the differential diagnosis of anemia?
4776,How would you frame the differential?
4777,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Anemia can occur in isolation, or as a consequence of a process caus -
ing pancytopenia, the reduction of all 3 cell lines (white blood cells 
[WBCs], platelets, and red blood cells [RBCs])."
4778,"This chapter focuses 
on the approach to isolated anemia, although a brief list of causes of 
pancytopenia appears in Figure 6-1."
4779,"The first step in determining the 
cause of anemia is to identify the general mechanism of the anemia 
and organize the mechanisms using a pathophysiologic framework:
A."
4780,Acute blood loss:  this is generally clinically obvious.
4781,"B. Underproduction  of RBCs by the bone marrow; chronic 
blood loss is included in this category because it leads to iron 
deficiency, which ultimately results in underproduction."
4782,"C. Increased destruction  of RBCs, called hemolysis."
4783,"Patients should always be assessed for signs and 
symptoms of acute blood loss."

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
4889,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
4890,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The first step is to determine the mechanism of Mrs. A’s anemia."
4891,Mrs. A is not having any symptoms or signs of acute blood loss.
4892,"She does have diseases associated with chronic blood loss: reflux 
possibly causing esophagitis and occasional menorrhagia."
4893,"However, 
it is not possible to distinguish underproduction from hemolysis 
based on the history."
4894,"Although the change in her CBC tells you a 
new process is going on, it also does not distinguish between these 
2 mechanisms."
4895,The first pivotal point will be her reticulocyte count.
4896,"Always look at previous CBC results to see if 
the anemia is new, old, or progressive."
4897,"1
Mrs. A’s reticulocyte count is 1.5%, which is an absolute 
reticulocyte count of 54,000/mcL, and an RPI of 0.39."
4898,"Now that you have found that Mrs. A has an 
underproduction anemia, what is the leading 
hypothesis, what are the active alternatives, 
and is there a must not miss diagnosis?"
4899,"Given 
this differential diagnosis, what tests should 
be ordered?"
4900,"Mrs. A’s MCV is 76 mcm3, so you should consider the differ -
ential diagnosis for microcytic anemia."
4901,"However, it is important to 
keep in mind that the MCV is not specific and should not be used 
to rule in or rule out a specific cause of anemia."
4902,A.
4903,"In one study, normal MCVs were found in 50% of patients 
with abnormal serum vitamin B12, folate, or iron studies."
4904,1.
4905,"5% of patients with iron deficiency had high MCVs
2."
4906,"12% of patients with vitamin B12 or folate deficiency had 
low MCVs
B."
4907,What about the rest of the CBC?
4908,Do the other indices help?
4909,1.
4910,"Other red cell indices (mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
[MCH] and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 
[MCHC]) tend to trend with the MCV and are not 
particularly sensitive or specific."
4911,2.
4912,"The red cell distribution width (RDW) is also not sensitive 
or specific in identifying the cause of an anemia."
4913,"Despite this caveat about the MCV, in a patient with a micro -
cytic anemia and symptoms suggesting possible chronic blood 
loss, iron deficiency is by far the most likely cause, with a pretest 
probability of 80%."
4914,"Therefore, the leading hypothesis for Mrs. A 
is iron deficiency anemia."

Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
4946,"Bone marrow exam for absence of iron stores is the gold stan -
dard but is rarely necessary."
4947,B.
4948,The serum ferritin is the best serum test.
4949,1.
4950,"The LR+ for a decreased serum ferritin is very high, with 
reports ranging from LR+ of 51 for a ferritin < 15 ng/mL 
to a LR+ of 46 for a ferritin < 30 ng/mL."
4951,2.
4952,"Thus, a low ferritin rules in iron deficiency anemia."
4953,3.
4954,"In general populations, the LR– for a serum ferritin  
> 100 ng/mL is very low (0.08)."
4955,4.
4956,"Thus, in general populations, a ferritin > 100 ng/mL 
greatly reduces the probability the patient has iron deficiency."
4957,5.
4958,"However, because ferritin is an acute phase reactant that 
increases in inflammatory states, interpreting it in the 
presence of such illnesses is difficult."
4959,a.
4960,"There is a wide range of reported LRs, with many 
studies finding ferritin is not helpful in diagnosing iron 
deficiency in the presence of chronic illness."
4961,b.
4962,"The level at which the serum ferritin suggests iron 
deficiency is probably much higher in patients with 
chronic illness, but the level may vary depending on 
the underlying illness."
4963,"c. In chronic kidney disease, iron abnormalities are defined 
using the transferrin saturation (serum iron/total iron-
binding capacity [Fe/TIBC]) and ferritin."
4964,"(1) Absolute iron deficiency, due to dietary deficiency, 
poor absorption, GI or other bleeding: transferrin 
saturation < 20%, ferritin < 100 ng/mL
(2) Functional iron deficiency, due to impaired iron 
transport to erythroblasts and inhibited intestinal 
absorption: transferrin saturation < 20%, ferritin  
≥ 100 ng/mL
C. Other tests
1."
4965,"The serum iron, MCV, transferrin saturation, red cell 
protoporphyrin, red cell ferritin, and RDW all are less 
sensitive and specific than ferritin."
4966,2.
4967,"The best of these is transferrin saturation ≤ 5%, with an 
LR+ of 10.46."
4968,3.
4969,"Response to a therapeutic trial of iron replacement can also 
be used to confirm the diagnosis in unclear cases."
4970,"In patients without chronic inflammatory dis -
eases, the serum ferritin is the best single test to 
diagnose iron deficiency anemia.Treatment
A."
4971,"Iron deficiency anemia is generally treated with oral iron 
replacement, with IV iron therapy reserved for patients who 
demonstrate malabsorption or who are unable to tolerate oral 
iron."
4972,"B. T ransfusion is necessary only if the patient is hypotensive or 
actively bleeding; has angina, dizziness, syncope, severe dysp -
nea or severe fatigue; or a very low hemoglobin < 7 g/dL."
4973,"C. The best-absorbed oral iron is ferrous sulfate; the optimal dose 
is unclear but ranges from 15–150 mg of elemental iron every 
1–2 days (325 mg of iron sulfate contains 65 mg of elemental 
iron)."
4974,"D. There can be significant GI side effects, including nausea, 
abdominal pain, and constipation; these can be reduced by 
taking the iron with food, reducing the dose, or increasing the 
dosing interval; switching to IV iron may be necessary."
4975,"E. There should be an increase in reticulocytes 7–10 days after 
starting therapy and an increase in Hb and HCT by 14 days."
4976,"F. If there is no response, reconsider the diagnosis, keeping in 
mind that adherence with iron therapy is often low."
4977,"G. It is necessary to take iron for 6 months in order to replete 
iron stores, though Hb levels may return to normal by 
6–8 weeks."
4978,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
Since Mrs. A does not have any chronic, inflammatory diseases, 
the most useful test at this point is a serum ferritin."
4979,"Serum iron 
and TIBC are often ordered simultaneously but are not necessary 
at this point."

Y ou review the history, looking for symptoms of bleeding 
or chronic illness."

4983,"Y ou order a serum ferritin, 
which is 5 ng/mL."
4984,"CASE RESOLUTION
1
With a pretest probability of 80% and an LR+ of 51 for 
this level of ferritin, Mrs. A is clearly iron deficient."
4985,"It is not 
necessary to test for any other causes of anemia, but it is 
necessary to determine why she is iron deficient."
4986,"Always look for a source of blood loss in iron 
deficiency anemia."
4987,"Be alert for occult GI 
malignancies."
4988,"Iron deficiency is almost always due to chronic blood loss and 
rarely due to poor iron intake or malabsorption of iron; menstrual 
and GI blood loss are the most common sources."
4989,"Because GI blood 
loss can be occult, many patients need GI evaluations."
4990,A.
4991,Which patients with iron deficiency need a GI workup?
4992,"(also 
see Chapter 19, GI Bleeding)
1."
4993,"All men, all women without menorrhagia, and women over 
age 50 even with menorrhagia."
4994,"Stern_ch06_p105-p120.indd   109 13/07/19   1:48 pm110 / CHAPTER 6
2."
4995,"Women under age 50 with menorrhagia do not need 
further GI evaluation, unless they have GI symptoms or a 
family history of early colon cancer or adenomatous polyps."
4996,3.
4997,"Always ask carefully about minimal GI symptoms in young 
women, since celiac disease often causes iron deficiency 
due to malabsorption, and the symptoms can easily be 
attributed to irritable bowel syndrome."
4998,"It is unclear from Mrs. A’s history whether the menorrhagia is 
sufficient to cause this degree of iron deficiency anemia."
4999,"In addition, 
she has upper GI symptoms of anorexia and reflux."
5000,"Therefore, you 
order an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which shows severe 
reflux esophagitis and also gastritis."
5001,"Further history reveals she has 
been using several hundred milligrams of ibuprofen daily for several 
weeks because of a back strain."
5002,"The severe esophagitis and gastritis 
are sufficient to explain her anemia."
5003,"Although she has no lower GI 
symptoms or family history of colorectal cancer, the American Gas -
troenterological Association recommends performing a colonoscopy."
5004,"FOLLOW-UP OF MRS. A

Mrs. A stopped the ibuprofen, substituted a proton pump 
inhibitor for the H2-blocker, and completed 6 months of 
iron therapy."
5005,She felt fine.
5006,"A follow-up CBC showed an Hb of  
13 g/dL, an HCT of 39%, and a significantly elevated MCV 
of 122 mcm3."
5007,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
5008,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
5009,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Although Mrs. A is not anemic now, she has a marked macro -
cytosis."
5010,"The approach to isolated macrocytosis is the same as the 
approach to macrocytic anemia."
5011,"The degree of macrocytosis is 
not a reliable predictor of the cause, but in general, the higher the 
MCV, the more likely the patient has a vitamin B12 or folate defi -
ciency."
5012,"The pretest probability of vitamin deficiency with an MCV 
of 115–129 mcm3 is 50%, and nearly all patients with an MCV  
> 130 mcm3 will have a vitamin deficiency."
5013,"B12 deficiency is seen more often than folate deficiency in oth -
erwise healthy people, and so is the leading hypothesis, with folate 
deficiency being the active alternative."
5014,"Use of antimetabolite drugs 
is excluded by history."
5015,"Causes of nonmegaloblastic anemias need 
to be considered next."
5016,"Hypothyroidism would be the most likely 
other hypothesis, with liver disease and alcohol abuse less likely

5067,"The sensitivity of a B12 level < 200 pg/mL for proven clinical 
B12 deficiency is 65–95%; the specificity is 60–80%."
5068,"B. B12 is a cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine to methi -
onine, and of methmalonyl CoA (MMA) to succinyl CoA."
5069,1.
5070,"Consequently, in B12 deficiency, the levels of homocysteine

chronic kidney disease and hypovolemia."
5075,b.
5076,"The sensitivity of MMA > 400 nmol/L for the diagnosis 
of B12 deficiency is 98%; modest elevations in the

mia in your list of other hypotheses."
5155,"Anemia is common in elderly 
patients, occurring in 10% of community-dwelling older adults."

A."
5250,"In macroangiopathic and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia 
and some complement-induced lysis, RBCs are destroyed in 
the intravascular space."
5251,1.
5252,"Completely destroyed cells release free Hb into the plasma, 
which then binds to haptoglobin,  reducing the plasma 
haptoglobin level."
5253,2.
5254,"Some Hb is filtered by the glomerulus, causing 
hemoglobinuria,  which darkens the urine."
5255,3.
5256,"Some filtered Hb is taken up by renal tubular cells, stored 
as hemosiderin; hemosiderinuria  occurs about a week 
later, when the tubular cells are sloughed into the urine."
5257,4.
5258,"Damaged but incompletely hemolyzed cells are destroyed 
in the spleen."
5259,"B. Deformed RBCs and those coated with complement are usually 
destroyed in the extravascular space,  in the liver or spleen."
5260,1.
5261,"Most of the Hb is degraded into biliverdin, iron, and 
carbon monoxide."
5262,2.
5263,"Biliverdin is converted to unconjugated bilirubin  and 
released into the plasma, increasing the unconjugated 
bilirubin level."

Sickle Cell Anemia
T extbook Presentation
Sickle cell anemia is often identified at birth through screening."
5324,"Adult patients generally seek medical attention for pain or some of 
the complications."
5325,"Occasionally, patients have very mild disease, 
and sickle cell is diagnosed late in life when evidence of a specific 
complication, such as sickle cell retinopathy, is identified.Disease Highlights
A."
5326,"Epidemiology
1."
5327,"There are 5 haplotypes, 4 African, and 1 Asian 
(Arab-Indian)."
5328,2.
5329,"Common genotypes include
a. Sickle cell anemia (homozygous HbS gene)
b. SC disease (HbS + HbC genes)
c. HbS-beta-thalassemia (HbS + beta0 or beta+ thalassemia 
gene)
d. HbSO Arabia (HbS + HbO Arabia genes)
e. HbSD Los Angeles [Punjab] (HbS + HbD genes)
3."
5330,"In African Americans, the gene frequency of HbS is 4%,  
of HbC is 1.5%, and of beta-thalassemia is 4%; the 
incidence of sickle cell anemia is about 1 in 600, with the 
incidence of all sickle cell disease genotypes approaching  
1 in 300."

5332,"In non-Hispanic white births, the gene frequency for sickle 
cell or thalassemia is 0.17%."

1."
5334,"Vaso-occlusion with ischemia-reperfusion injury
a. Vascular obstruction is caused by precapillary 
obstruction by sickled cells and inflammatory triggers."
5335,"b. Episodic microvascular occlusion and ischemia is 
followed by restoration of blood flow, leading to further 
injury during reperfusion as oxidases, cytokines, and 
other inflammatory mediators are activated."
5336,2.
5337,"Hemolysis
a. Contributes to progressive vasculopathy
b."
5338,"Patients with high hemolytic rates are more anemic 
and have more cholelithiasis, leg ulcerations, priapism,

more episodes of acute pain and possibly acute chest 
syndrome."

5343,Genetic factors can affect prognosis.
5344,a.
5345,"Higher levels of fetal hemoglobin are associated with 
increased life expectancy, fewer acute pain episodes, and 
fewer leg ulcers; levels range from 1% to 30%."
5346,"b. Coexistent alpha-thalassemia (30% of patients of 
African origin, 50% of patients of Arabian or Indian 
origin) leads to decreased rates of hemolysis and 
increased hemoglobin levels; pain frequency is not 
reduced, but the rates of stroke, gallstones, leg ulcers, 
and priapism are lower."

1."
5348,"Hematologic
a. HCT usually 20–30%, with reticulocyte count of 
3–15%; patients with HbSC disease and HbS-beta+-
thalassemia tend to be less anemic."
5349,"b. Hb levels decrease slightly during acute pain episodes 
and episodes of acute chest syndrome; acute, marked 
decreases can occur due to transient aplasia from 
parvovirus B19 infections or sudden sequestration by 
the liver or spleen."
5350,"c. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LD, and 
low haptoglobin are present."

5362,Pathophysiology of sickle cell disease.
5363,"The roles of HbS polymerization, hyperviscosity, vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and 
endothelial dysfunction are shown."
5364,"Deoxygenation causes HbS to polymerize, leading to sickled erythrocytes."
5365,"Vaso-occlusion results from 
the interaction of sickled erythrocytes with leukocytes and the vascular endothelium."
5366,"Vaso-occlusion then leads to infarction, hemolysis, 
and inflammation; inflammation enhances the expression of adhesion molecules, further increasing the tendency of sickled erythrocytes 
to adhere to the vascular endothelium to worsen vaso-occlusion."
5367,"Reperfusion of the ischemic tissue generates free radicals and oxidative 
damage."
5368,"The damaged erythrocytes release free hemoglobin into the plasma, which strongly bind to nitric oxide, causing functional nitric 
oxide deficiency and contributing to the development of vasculopathy."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Mr. Y is a 30-year-old man with low back pain that has 
lasted for 6 days."
5539,"What is the differential diagnosis of low back 
pain?"
5540,How would you frame the differential?
5541,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Most low back pain is caused by conditions that are troublesome 
but not progressive or life-threatening."
5542,"The primary task when 
evaluating patients with low back pain is to identify those who 
have a serious cause of back pain that requires specific, and some -
times rapid, diagnosis and treatment."
5543,"In practice, this means dis -
tinguishing serious  back pain (pain due to a systemic or visceral 
disease or pain with significant neurologic symptoms or signs) 
from nonspecific  back pain related to the musculoskeletal structures 
of the back, called mechanical back pain."

differential diagnosis reflects this task."

Mr. Y felt well until 1 week ago, when he helped his girlfriend 
move into her third-floor apartment."

there a must not miss diagnosis?"
5583,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
5584,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mr. Y’s history of a specific precipitant and diffuse back pain is 
consistent with nonspecific mechanical back pain, which is the 
cause of 95% of the back pain seen in a primary care practice."
5585,"History and physical exam should focus on looking for neurologic 
signs and symptoms that would suggest a specific musculoskele -
tal cause, such as a herniated disk, and for signs and symptoms 
that would suggest the presence of a systemic disease."
5586,"Signs and 
symptoms of neurologic or systemic disease are pivotal points in 
the assessment of back pain."

diagnosis?"
5597,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"

specific or serious causes of back pain, limiting the differential at 
this point to nonspecific, mechanical low back pain."

5630,"E. Imaging does not improve clinical outcomes, such as pain or 
functional status, especially in patients with acute (< 4 weeks)

Mrs. P has several pivotal clinical findings that suggest her back 
pain could be due to a more serious, systemic disease rather than 
being nonspecific, mechanical back pain."
5796,"First, she is older and 
has a history of cancer; both findings are associated with malig -
nancy as a cause of back pain."

previous fracture are established risk factors for osteoporosis."
5798,"In 
addition, aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole increase bone loss 
and are associated with an increased risk of fractures (OR = 1.47)."

sion fracture and is therefore both the leading and must not miss 
hypothesis."

cord, cauda equina, individual nerve roots, and the arterioles 
and capillaries supplying the cauda equina and nerve roots."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Ms. A is a 24-year-old woman who comes to see you 
because her gums are bleeding when she brushes her teeth."
6229,What is the differential diagnosis of bleeding?
6230,How would you frame the differential?
6231,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The framework for bleeding distinguishes between structural 
causes (ie, an injury to the tissue or organ), platelet-related causes, 
and clotting factor–related causes."
6232,"Bleeding due to platelet abnor -
malities, whether due to reduced number or abnormal function 
of platelets, is usually small vessel bleeding, and produces such 
findings as petechiae, bruising, gum bleeding, or nosebleeds."
6233,"The 
bleeding starts and persists immediately following the injury that 
induces it."
6234,"Platelet-related bleeding is generally not quantitatively 
significant (ie, platelet-related bleeding tends not to cause serious 
blood loss requiring red cell transfusions)."
6235,"Nonetheless, platelet- 
related bleeding can still be clinically important if a patient bleeds 
a small amount into the brain (unusual unless the platelet count 
is < 10,000/mcL) or induces an abdominal hematoma from vigorous 
coughing, for example."
6236,"By contrast, bleeding due to coagulation 
factor deficiencies or inhibitors tends to be delayed; that is, a plate -
let plug slows or stops the bleeding immediately after an injury, 
but the platelet plug is then not bolstered by the stable fibrin clot 
that is meant to definitively stop the bleeding."
6237,"Bleeding due to 
coagulation factor abnormalities is more likely to be quantitatively 
significant, generally occurring in joints, the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract, brain, retroperitoneum, or at sites of recent injury or medical 
or surgical intervention."

6271,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
6272,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
6273,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
There are several pivotal points in Ms. A’s presentation that sug -
gest her bleeding is due to a platelet disorder: the bleeding occurs 
immediately after the trauma of tooth brushing, she has petechiae 
on her skin, and the bleeding is small volume."
6274,"The second pivotal point is that her history further suggests that 
her platelet disorder is acquired."
6275,"If she had a congenital platelet disorder, such as von Willebrand disease, she might have had life-
long heavy menses and other manifestations of bleeding."
6276,"In this 
case, her symptoms just began 2 weeks ago."
6277,"A platelet count will 
confirm that her bleeding is related to thrombocytopenia, rather 
than platelet dysfunction, which is less commonly seen."
6278,"(If the 
platelet count is normal, platelet dysfunction should be suspected, 
and a test such as the PFA-100 assay should be ordered."
6279,"This test is 
a reproducible screening tool for platelet function abnormalities."
6280,"It 
measures the time to formation of a platelet plug in response to col -
lagen along with adenosine diphosphate [ADP] or epinephrine.)"
6281,"The most common cause of thrombocytopenia in a young woman 
with no signs of systemic illness is idiopathic autoimmune throm -
bocytopenia."
6282,"Although Ms. A’s headache is mild and she looks well, 
TTP can present with headache and thrombocytopenia and also 
tends to occur in young women."
6283,"Finally, it is critical to remem -
ber that the platelets are only 1 of the cell lines affected by bone 
marrow disorders, and that a serious bone marrow condition 
(eg, acute leukemia) might first manifest as thrombocytopenia."
6284,"A 
key step, then, is to decide if the thrombocytopenia is isolated or 
part of a pancytopenia picture, such as one might encounter with 
acute leukemia."
6285,Table 8-1 lists the differential diagnosis.
6286,"1
Ms. A’s laboratory tests indicate a WBC of 5600/mcL, 
RBC of 3.9 million/mcL, Hb of 11.2 g/dL, HCT of 33.5%, 
and platelet count 8000/mcL."

the trigger for antibody formation is unknown."
6338,3.
6339,"The lack of the enzyme leads to the ultra-large von 
Willebrand multimers causing platelet aggregation 
and clumping in the microcirculation, leading to 
thrombocytopenia."
6340,4.
6341,"These clumps cause red blood cells passing over them to be 
physically damaged, leading to the characteristic finding on 
the blood smear of schistocytes, or fragmented red blood cells."
6342,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
6343,"A plasma test demonstrating reduced ADAMTS13 activity 
and a positive test for the anti-ADAMTS13 antibody reliably 
establish the diagnosis."
6344,B.
6345,"The diagnosis of TTP is made clinically, since the ADAMTS13 
assay result may take several days to return, and the disease has 
critical morbidity and mortality if treatment is delayed."
6346,1.
6347,"Any patient with thrombocytopenia (usually below 
30,000/mcL) and evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis 
(schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, elevated serum 
lactate dehydrogenase (LD) level, reduced serum 
haptoglobin level) should raise concern about TTP ."
6348,2.
6349,"If neurologic signs or acute kidney injury is present, the 
diagnosis becomes even more likely."
6350,3.
6351,"The “PLASMIC” score is a way to predict the likelihood 
of finding a low ADAMTS13 activity level diagnostic 
for TTP ."
6352,a.
6353,"It is based on the presence or absence of 7 clinical 
features:
(1) Platelet count < 30,000/mcL
(2) Hemolysis
(3) Absence of active cancer
(4) Absence of solid organ or stem cell transplantation
(5) Mean corpuscular volume < 90 fl
(6) INR < 1.5
(7) Creatinine < 2.0 mg/dLb."
6354,"If 6 or 7 of these features are present, the likelihood of 
ADAMTS13 activity being < 10% is very high."
6355,"Think about TTP in patients with thrombocy -

6356,"Treatment
A."
6357,Plasma exchange is the mainstay of treatment of TTP .
6358,"While 
it is complicated and expensive, it does not carry substantial 
medical risk."
6359,1.
6360,"Large volumes of plasma are removed from the patient and 
fresh plasma reinfused."
6361,2.
6362,"This removes the antibody to ADAMTS13 and provides 
plasma with a normal complement of the enzyme."
6363,3.
6364,"It is possible to treat TTP initially with plasma infusion 
alone, but plasma exchange allows for infusion of much 
higher volumes of plasma; hence, more efficient removal 
of antibody and infusion of enzyme."
6365,4.
6366,"Plasma exchange is performed daily, typically for 7–14 days, 
while monitoring the platelet count and LD levels."
6367,5.
6368,"Prior to the advent of plasma exchange, the mortality 
rate for TTP was about 90%."
6369,"With plasma exchange, the 
survival rate is now about 90%."
6370,"B. Immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone or rituximab 
are also used in an effort to reduce the production of the 
anti-ADAMTS13 antibody."

firmed by her thrombocytopenia."
6375,"There is no evidence to

tion use or underlying condition) making platelet destruc -
tion most likely."
6376,"Finally, this appears to be immune-mediated

cytes or hemolysis making the diagnosis of ITP appear

Mr. J is a 62-year-old man who underwent a coronary

artery disease."
6385,"He has remained in the hospital for manage -
ment of a postoperative sternal wound infection, has been 
doing well, and is scheduled for discharge later in the day."
6386,"His past history is notable for an autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia several years ago, successfully treated with pred -
nisone."
6387,"He drank 6 beers per day for years, quitting about 
6 months ago."
6388,"The laboratory pages you to report that his 
platelet count is 56,000/mcL."
6389,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
6390,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
6391,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The most common causes of new thrombocytopenia in hospi -
talized patients are medications, particularly heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia (HIT), and sepsis."
6392,"Therefore, the first steps 
in diagnosing thrombocytopenia in a hospitalized patient are to 
review previous platelet counts to determine whether the thrombo -
cytopenia is new, review the medication list, and look for vital signs 
suggestive of sepsis."
6393,"Because Mr. J has a history of autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, it is also important to consider autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia as an accompanying autoimmune phenome -
non (also called Evans syndrome, characterized by seeing sphero -
cytes rather than schistocytes in the peripheral smear), although 
this would otherwise be uncommon in his age group."
6394,"Finally, he 
could have cirrhosis due to his extensive alcohol intake over the 
years, with hypersplenism causing mild-to- moderate thrombocy -
topenia."
6395,"Chronic autoimmune hemolytic anemia might also cause 
splenic enlargement."
6396,"If hypersplenism is the cause, his platelet 
count at admission would probably have been somewhat low, 
typically between 40,000/mcL and 120,000/mcL."
6397,"Table 8-2 lists 
the differential diagnosis."
6398,"2
Mr. J’s vital signs are normal, and a recent nursing note 
reports that he finished his breakfast and looked fine."
6399,"He 
is receiving antibiotics for the wound infection and sub -
cutaneous heparin every 8 hours for prophylaxis against 
deep venous thrombosis."
6400,"His last platelet count was 
175,000/mcL 3 days ago."
6401,"The rest of his CBC results 
from today include WBC 14,600/mcL and Hb 11.8 g/dL, 
unchanged from previous Hb levels."
6402,"A chemistry profile, 
including liver enzymes and albumin, is normal."
6403,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"

T extbook Presentation
The classic presentation of HIT is a hospitalized patient receiving 
heparin whose platelet count falls by more than 50% from baseline, 
though generally to a level still above 50,000/mcL."
6407,"There may be asso -
ciated thrombosis, either venous (deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, venous limb gangrene) or arterial (cold digits or extremity)."
6408,Skin necrosis at the site of heparin injections may also be seen.
6409,"Disease Highlights
A."
6410,"Caused by the development of an antibody directed against 
a heparin-platelet factor 4 complex; the antibody occurs 
more commonly with unfractionated heparin than with low-
molecular- weight heparin."
6411,"The antibody causes aggregation 
and activation of platelets, which paradoxically increases the 
risk of thrombosis."
6412,B.
6413,Develops in about 5% of patients who receive heparin.
6414,C. Surgical patients are at higher risk.
6415,"D. HIT manifests between 5 and 10 days after starting any kind 
of heparin—full-dose intravenous heparin, low-dose prophy -
lactic heparin, or even just heparin flushes to maintain patency 
of indwelling intravascular catheters."
6416,"Thrombocytopenia may 
develop earlier in patients with recent heparin exposure."
6417,"Any exposure to heparin, including small heparin 
flushes, can lead to HIT."
6418,"E. Thrombosis develops in about 50% of patients who have HIT, 
and the thrombosis may be evident at the same time as the 
platelet count drop, though it may also be delayed by several 
days or weeks."
6419,"Thrombosis may be arterial (previously called 
the white clot syndrome), although it is more often venous."
6420,"Stern_ch08_p139-p150.indd   144 11/07/19   4:59 pmBLEEDING DISORDERS  / 145
F. The platelet count does not usually drop below 50,000/mcL 
in HIT; a lower platelet count suggests another etiology."
6421,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
6422,"The most sensitive, readily available screening test is an enzyme-  
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-PF4 antibody."
6423,1.
6424,"It is nearly 100% sensitive, although specificity is between 
75% and 85%."
6425,"Thus, a negative test is very reassuring that 
HIT is not present, but false-positive tests are not uncommon."
6426,2.
6427,"The serotonin-release assay (SRA) is more specific but not 
readily available; it can be run if a false-positive ELISA is 
suspected."
6428,B.
6429,"Because the poor specificity of the anti-PF4 assay leads to 
overdiagnosis of HIT, a pretest probability scoring system 
(the 4“T’s”) has been validated."

Treatment
A. Heparin must be discontinued whenever HIT is suspected, 
even when the anti-PF4 assay result is not yet available.B."
6453,"An alternative anticoagulant must be started to prevent 
HIT-associated thrombosis, regardless of whether the initial 
indication for anticoagulation is still present; generally, a direct 
thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban is used."
6454,1.
6455,"Low-molecular-weight heparin may not be substituted: 
although the incidence of HIT with low-molecular-weight 
heparin is much lower than with unfractionated heparin, 
once HIT occurs, there is too much risk for cross-reactivity."
6456,2.
6457,"Similarly, warfarin should not be used until the platelet 
count has recovered (this takes a few days) but can then be 
started while the direct thrombin inhibitor is being given."
6458,3.
6459,Anticoagulation should continue for 2–3 months.
6460,"C. Although not specifically approved for this indication, 
fondaparinux, a factor X inhibitor, has sometimes been used as 
an alternative anticoagulant in patients with HIT."
6461,"D. Surprisingly, patients with a history of HIT may safely be 
reexposed to heparin, if necessary, after a year has passed 
and the antibody has presumably disappeared."
6462,"This may be 
an issue particularly for patients requiring extracorporeal 
circulatory support for cardiac surgery, for example."

PATIENT 3
Ms. W is a 56-year-old woman who comes to the office 
complaining of poor appetite for several weeks and black, 
tarry stools with generalized weakness for 1 day."
6487,"She has no prior history of bleeding, and her 3 prior 
obstetric deliveries were uncomplicated."
6488,"Her past history 
is notable for cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C. Her medi -
cations include spironolactone and metoprolol; additionally, 
she has been taking ibuprofen for back pain."
6489,"On examination, she is pale."
6490,"Her blood pressure is 
110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 112 bpm, RR is 16 breaths per 
minute, temperature is 37.1°C."
6491,"Her conjunctivae are pale, 
mucous membranes moist, lungs clear, heart regular rhythm 
with a systolic flow murmur at the left sternal border, liver 
minimally enlarged with a nodular edge, spleen palpable 3 cm 
below the left costal margin in the anterior axillary line, and 
she has no edema."
6492,"Digital rectal examination discloses 
black stool that is Hemoccult-positive."
6493,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
6494,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
6495,"Ms. W’s presentation suggests that she is having an upper GI 
bleed."
6496,"In addition to the specific GI causes of upper GI bleeding 
discussed in Chapter 19, GI Bleeding, it is important to consider 
whether patients who are bleeding have an underlying platelet or 
coagulation disorder contributing to the bleeding."
6497,"Ms. W does 
have cirrhosis with splenomegaly that could lead to thrombocy -
topenia due to splenic sequestration; however, the large volume of 
the bleeding suggests a coagulation factor disorder."
6498,"The prothrombin time (PT) measures what is commonly 
called the “extrinsic” clotting pathway (Figure 8-2), wherein tissue 
factor from an injury activates factor VII, followed by activation 
of the coagulation cascade through the “common pathway” factors 
(factors V, X, II [prothrombin] and I [fibrinogen])."
6499,"Because the 
source of tissue factor reagents used in the laboratory to trigger the 
cascade vary, the PT will vary among different laboratories when 
testing the same sample."
6500,"To overcome this problem of PT results 
not being comparable from one laboratory to another, the inter -
national normalized ratio (INR) was developed, to standardize PT 
results based on a constant associated with each laboratory reagent."
6501,"The INR, which is routinely reported along with the PT, allows the 
clinician to be confident that the data from different laboratories 
are comparable."
6502,"The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measures 
what is commonly called the “intrinsic” clotting pathway, start -
ing with factor XII and working through factors XI, IX, and VIII 
before entering the common pathway."
6503,"In the evaluation of a prolonged clotting time, either PT or 
aPTT, one considers whether only one test is prolonged, and which 
factors contribute to each test."
6504,"For example, an isolated prolonged 
PT suggests a deficiency or inhibitor of factor VII, since that is the 
only factor unique to the PT assay."
6505,"An isolated prolonged aPTT 
raises concern about the 4 factors that are unique to the aPTT—
factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII."
6506,"Prolongation of both the PT and 
aPTT raises concern either about the factors in the common 
pathway—I, II, V, and X—or a defect in multiple factors."
6507,"Table 8-3 
summarizes commonly seen patterns of factor deficiencies.In clinical practice, prolongation of clotting times is most 
commonly acquired, either due to acquired deficiencies (eg, from 
malnutrition or liver disease) or acquired factor inhibitors."

6510,"In order to distinguish between a 
factor deficiency and an inhibitor, it is often helpful to perform a 
mixing study, wherein one mixes 1:1 the patient’s plasma and nor -
mal plasma, to see if the clotting time corrects."
6511,"If it does correct, 
the normal plasma has provided the missing factor to the patient’s 
plasma, indicating the abnormality is due to a factor deficiency."
6512,"If it does not correct, the implication is that an inhibitor in the 
patient’s plasma is inactivating the clotting factor(s) from the 
normal plasma."
6513,"Such inhibitors may be exogenous, such as inad -

T extbook Presentation
The classic presentation of liver disease–induced coagulopathy is 
variable."
6530,"Patients may be asymptomatic, only discovered to have 
a coagulopathy incidentally on coagulation laboratory studies."
6531,"Spontaneous bleeding is uncommon, but anything that stresses 
the patient (such as an injury, an operative procedure, or perhaps 
NSAID-induced gastritis) may lead to more bleeding than one 
might normally anticipate with that event in someone without 
liver disease."
6532,"Disease Highlights
A."
6533,"Patients with liver disease–induced coagulopathy typically have 
a disproportionately longer PT (and therefore higher INR) 
than aPTT.B."
6534,"The coagulopathy is caused by impaired production of clotting 
factors by the diseased liver; the clotting factor with the shortest 
half-life, namely factor VII, would be expected to be most 
prominently affected."
6535,"Since the PT/INR is so sensitive to 
factor VII levels, that test is more notably abnormal."
6536,"C. Coagulopathy is seen primarily in patients with severe liver 
disease."
6537,"The liver has a considerable reserve, and only when the 
impairment is severe does one find significant coagulopathy."
6538,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
6539,"In a patient with liver disease who is bleeding or in whom 
an invasive procedure is planned, the PT/INR and aPTT 
should be checked in order to screen for coagulation factor 
deficiencies."
6540,1.
6541,"If the screening tests are significantly prolonged, one should 
check the levels of factor VII, factor V, factor II, factor IX, 
and factor X as well as fibrinogen to help determine which 
replacement therapy is most appropriate."
6542,2.
6543,"If factor VII is low but factor V normal, it suggests that 
vitamin K deficiency may be playing a role (especially if 
Stern_ch08_p139-p150.indd   147 11/07/19   4:59 pm148 / CHAPTER 8
history notes poor appetite for several weeks, suggesting an 
inadequate intake of vitamin K during that time), whereas 
in severe liver impairment, both factors V and VII are 
reduced."
6544,3.
6545,"Because all the clotting factors except factor VIII are 
produced in the hepatocytes, all of them except factor VIII 
may be low in severe liver disease."
6546,"Factor VIII is typically 
normal or even elevated in liver disease, a finding that may 
distinguish liver disease from DIC, in which factor VIII 
is low."
6547,B.
6548,"Another finding that may contribute to bleeding risk in severe 
liver disease is excessive fibrinolysis, the cause of which is a 
complex interplay between the production of and hepatic 
clearance of fibrinolytic activators and inhibitors."
6549,"C. While it may seem paradoxical, there may also be an increased 
risk of thrombosis in liver disease."
6550,"Several findings may 
account for this: reduction of the vitamin K–dependent 
anticoagulant proteins, protein C and protein S; and increases 
in factor VIII and sometimes von Willebrand factor."

helpful."

The usual presentation of vitamin K deficiency is a hospitalized

result of baseline vitamin K deficiency."

antibiotics that alter the gut flora’s ability to convert ingested 
vitamin K to its absorbable form."
6569,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
6570,"As with liver disease, patients with vitamin K deficiency have 
PT/INR levels disproportionately longer than aPTT levels."
6571,B.
6572,"This is due to factor VII having the shortest half-life of the 
vitamin K–dependent factors (II, VII, IX, and X), thus making 
the factor VII–dependent PT/INR more sensitive to vitamin K 
alterations."
6573,"C. The aPTT will also go up eventually, as the levels of factors II, 
IX and X, with much longer half-lives, fall."
6574,"Treatment
A. Vitamin K repletion, either orally or parenterally, is the treatment 
of choice."
6575,1.
6576,"If parenteral treatment is chosen, it should be administered 
subcutaneously or intravenously—not intramuscularly."
6577,2.
6578,"Intramuscular injections should be avoided in patients 
with coagulopathies, in order to avoid the development 
of hematomas in muscles that can lead to neuropathy if a 
major nerve traverses the area."
6579,"B. Vitamin K administration takes 18–24 hours to have its 
effect, so if a patient with vitamin K deficiency is bleeding, 
fresh frozen plasma or four-factor prothrombin complex 
concentrate, which contains factors II, VII, IX, and X, 
may be required."

A."
6751,"Stable angina is a chest pain syndrome caused by a mismatch 
between myocardial oxygen supply and demand usually 
caused by coronary artery stenosis."
6752,B.
6753,Stable angina is a common first presentation for CHD.
6754,"C. Angina (stable and unstable) can also occur in the setting 
of normal or nearly normal coronary arteries and any of the 
following:
1."
6755,"Anemia
2."

3."
6757,"Aortic stenosis
4."
6758,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
5."
6759,"Heart failure (HF) (the result of high filling pressures 
leading to increased coronary resistance during diastole)

other than CHD."

of stable angina, other presentations are possible."

6779,"Although the pathophysiology of stable angina is the same 
in men and women, stable angina raises some unique issues 
in women that deserve comment."
6780,2.
6781,Stable angina presents differently in women than in men.
6782,a.
6783,"Because angina usually presents in women at an older 
age than in men, there are more comorbid diseases to 
complicate the presentation."
6784,b.
6785,"Women describe their chest pain differently, using terms 
like “burning” and “tender” more frequently."
6786,3.
6787,"There is good evidence that the diagnostic tests used for 
CHD, which are discussed later in this chapter, are less 
accurate in women than in men."

women,

6790,Physicians often do not consider the diagnosis.

with rest?”)
3."
6807,"Patients who answer yes to all 3 questions are 
classified as having typical angina, 2 positive answers 
as atypical angina, and 1 positive as nonanginal chest 
pain."
6808,"A patient who answers no to all questions is 
asymptomatic."
6809,"Use the patient’s own words when taking 
a history (eg, pressure, burning, aching, 
squeezing, piercing)."
6810,4.
6811,"The prevalence of CHD in each group is shown in 
Table 9-2."
6812,"A variety of online tools, such as the Pooled 
Cohort Risk Assessment Equations, can be used to 
estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk with a focus on 
identifying high-impact risk reduction interventions."
6813,5.
6814,"It is also useful to think of these data in terms of low-, 
intermediate-, and high-risk groups."
6815,"a. Low-risk (pretest probability < 15%):
(1) All asymptomatic patients
(2) Men with nonanginal chest pain who are younger 
than 50 years
(3) Women with nonanginal chest pain who are 
younger than 60 years
(4) Women under age 50 with atypical angina
b. Intermediate-risk (pretest probability 15–85%):
(1) Men over age 50 and women over age 60 with 
nonanginal chest pain
(2) Any man and any woman over age 50 with atypical 
angina
(3) Men under age 40 and women under age 60 with 
typical angina
c. High-risk (pretest probability > 85%): Men older than 
40 years and women older than 60 years with typical 
angina
6."
6816,"It is important to recognize that comorbidities can 
markedly influence the probability of disease."
6817,"As an 
example, the rate of CHD in a 55-year-old woman with 
atypical angina goes from about 32% with no risk factors 
to 47% with 1 risk factor (eg, diabetes mellitus, tobacco 
use, hypertension).7."
6818,"The remainder of the history should be aimed at collecting 
evidence that makes the diagnosis of CHD more likely, 
such as
a. Cardiac risk factors
b."
6819,"Past history of cardiac disease
c. Symptoms classic for other causes of chest pain

6821,"Unremitting pain of prolonged duration (days)
b."
6822,"Other explanations for the patient’s symptoms
9."
6823,"Tests that should be performed on initial presentation 
include
a. Glucose and lipid profile to identify diseases that 
increase the likelihood of chest pain being ischemic 
in origin."
6824,"b. Hb and thyroid-stimulating hormone to identify other 
diseases that may cause angina."
6825,"c. Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), looking for 
evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or previous 
infarction (Q-waves or ST-T wave changes)
d. T roponin, if recent anginal symptoms had been 
particularly severe or long-lasting."
6826,"B. Cardiac diagnostic testing
1."
6827,"Except in rare cases, patients with symptoms of stable 
angina should have further functional or anatomic exams 
(eg, stress testing or CT coronary angiogram, respectively) 
to detect inducible ischemia."
6828,2.
6829,"The test is used for 2 purposes: to diagnose CHD and 
risk stratify patients into treatment groups."
6830,"That is, to 
determine whether patients should be treated with risk 
factor reduction and medication only, percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass 
surgery."
6831,3.
6832,"Decisions about treatment are based on a number of 
factors, many coming from the results of cardiac diagnostic 
testing:
a."
6833,"The extent and severity of ischemia (most important)
b."
6834,"Other prognostic variables, such as aerobic ability, BP 
and heart rate response to exercise, and inducible left 
ventricular dysfunction."
6835,4.
6836,"All stress tests attempt to induce and detect myocardial 
ischemia."
6837,"a. Myocardial ischemia may be induced by exercise, 
dobutamine, adenosine, or dipyridamole."
6838,"b. Myocardial ischemia may be detected by ECG, 
echocardiogram, or nuclear stress imaging."

6842,"c. The sensitivity of an exercise test is decreased if the 
patient does not reach an adequate degree of exercise, 
as measured by the rate-pressure product."
6843,5.
6844,"Exercise electrocardiography is the simplest and least 
expensive test though it less sensitive and specific than 
exercise tests that use more modern forms of imaging."
6845,a.
6846,It requires a normal resting ECG.
6847,b.
6848,"The sensitivity of the exercise stress test can be improved 
(at the cost of lower specificity) by reducing the degree 
of ST depression needed for a positive test."
6849,6.
6850,"The sensitivity, specificity, and LRs of some of the various 
tests are shown in Table 9-3."
6851,"(It should be noted that 
the test characteristics of stress thallium and dobutamine 
echocardiography vary among healthcare centers.)"
6852,7.
6853,"Considerable debate exists regarding the use of anatomic 
(ie, CT coronary artery) versus functional (ie, exercise stress 
or stress imaging studies) exams for the initial evaluation 
of CHD."
6854,8.
6855,"The decision whether to order a routine exercise test or 
one with imaging is difficult."
6856,"In general, reasons to obtain 
imaging are
a. Abnormal resting ECG
b."
6857,"Previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 
surgery or PCI
c. A high pretest probability of disease."
6858,"In these cases, only 
a highly sensitive test can exclude disease and the test 
is being done more to risk stratify than to diagnoses 
CHD."
6859,"Because of the relatively low sensitivity of 
ECG stress tests, these should only be used 
to exclude the diagnosis of CHD in low-risk 
patients."
6860,9.
6861,"Means of increasing coronary demand other than

native presentation."
6929,"Patients often report that their symptoms are 
worst at night and after large meals."

Prior to the stress test, Mr. W’s probability of having CHD was at 
least 92% (see Table 9-2)."
7023,"It is important to understand why the 
stress test was done in this case."
7024,"The diagnosis of coronary disease 
was essentially made by the history and physical."
7025,"The stress test was 
meant to guide therapy."
7026,"Considering a pretest probability of 92%, 
and a LR– of about 0.15 for the stress test, the posttest probability 
is 60%."
7027,"This is still well above the test threshold for a potentially 
fatal disease like CHD."
7028,"Despite the results of the stress test, stable angina was con -
sidered more likely than GERD."

Mrs. G is a 68-year-old woman with a history of hyperten -

lance complaining of chest burning that began 6 hours ago."
7034,"Two hours after eating, moderate (5/10) chest discomfort 
developed."
7035,"The pain begins in her mid-chest and radiates to 
her back."
7036,"She initially attributed the pain to heartburn and 
used antacids."
7037,"Despite multiple doses over 3 hours, there 
was no relief."
7038,"Over the last hour, the pain became very severe 
(10/10) with radiation to her back and arms."
7039,"The pain is 
associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath."

pain is not pleuritic."

is sedentary, and smokes 1 pack of cigarettes each day for 
the past 30 years."

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"

differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
7046,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mrs. G is an elderly woman with hypertension and a 30 pack-
year smoking history who is experiencing acute, nonpleuritic, chest 
pain."
7047,"Referring to Figure 9-2, multiple “must not miss” diagno -
ses including ACS, AAS, and PE, must be considered."
7048,"Given the 
patient’s presentation, age, and risk factors, ACS is most likely."
7049,"AAS is also possible given the patient’s history of hypertension and 
the pain’s radiation to her back, though the progressive onset of 
the pain is somewhat atypical for AAS."
7050,"Though PE remains on the 
differential, there is nothing in the presentation that specifically 
raises the likelihood of this must not miss diagnosis."
7051,"Other less 
life-threatening diagnoses, such as esophageal spasm, GERD, and 
pancreatitis, should also be included on the differential diagnosis 
(Table 9-5)."
7052,"While the physical exam cannot reliably distinguish ACS, AAD, 
and PE, a brief, yet thorough, exam is recommended to identify 
hemodynamic instability, highly specific signs of a life-threatening 
diagnosis, or precipitating causes."
7053,"Referring again to the algorithm in Figure 9-2, the first pivotal point is to distinguish between an 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and all other causes 
of acute chest pain."
7054,"This reflects international guidelines recom -
mending that a 12-lead ECG be performed and interpreted within 
10 minutes of a patient’s arrival to an emergency department as 
STEMI mortality outcomes are largely determined by time to 
reperfusion therapy."

T extbook Presentation
The textbook presentation of an acute MI is a middle-aged man 
with risk factors for CHD with crushing substernal chest pressure, 
diaphoresis, nausea, shortness of breath, and a feeling of impending 
doom."
7074,"Unfortunately, this textbook description does not account 
for the frequency of MI in women, younger and older patients, and 
the frequency of atypical presentations."
7075,"Disease Highlights
A. MI occurs when there is a prolonged failure to perfuse an area 
of myocardium leading to cell necrosis."
7076,B.
7077,"Most commonly occurs when a coronary plaque ruptures 
causing thrombosis and subsequent blockage of a coronary 
artery."
7078,"C. The universal definition of MI describes 5 subtypes of MI 
based on their etiology:
1."
7079,"Type 1:  Spontaneous MI due to a primary coronary event
2."
7080,"Type 2:  MI secondary to ischemia due to either increased 
oxygen demand or decreased supply, eg, coronary artery 
spasm, anemia, or arrhythmias
3."
7081,"Type 3:  Sudden unexpected cardiac death, including 
cardiac arrest, often with symptoms suggestive of 
myocardial ischemia
4."
7082,"Type 4:  MI associated with PCI or stent thrombosis
5."
7083,"Type 5:  MI associated with CABG
D. MIs are broadly classified as either STEMI or non–ST- 
segment elevation MI (nSTEMI)
1."
7084,"STEMI
a."
7085,"Involves transmural ischemia or infarction
b."
7086,"Typically caused by complete occlusion of a coronary 
artery
c. Initial diagnosis of STEMI involves strict 12-lead

7122,"Historically, cardiac biomarker panels include serum creatine 
kinase MB subunit (CK-MB) and troponin."
7123,"Increasingly, 
centers are relying on troponin or high-sensitivity troponin 
measurements to make the diagnosis."
7124,3.

7131,"Patients with kidney disease often have elevated troponin 
levels raising the risk of false-positive tests for MI."
7132,b.
7133,"Patients with elevated troponin levels at baseline will 
still have a diagnostic rise and fall with MI."
7134,"c. In patients with chronic kidney disease, higher baseline 
troponin levels are predictive of poor cardiovascular 
outcomes."
7135,"E. Atypical presentations
1."
7136,"Although the combination of symptoms, ECG findings, 
and enzymes make most MIs easy to diagnose, about 
2% of patients with acute MI are not diagnosed and are 
discharged from the emergency department.2."
7137,"Failure to recognize an MI results in worse outcomes for 
patients and is a common cause of medical negligence claims."
7138,3.
7139,"MIs most commonly go unrecognized when they present in 
unusual ways or in people not expected to have MI."
7140,4.
7141,"A patient with an MI or UA who is mistakenly discharged 
is most likely to
a."
7142,"Be a woman younger than age 55
b."
7143,"Be non-white
c. Have a chief complaint of shortness of breath
d. Have a nondiagnostic ECG
5."

listed below."
7145,"MI should be considered in patients being 
discharged from the emergency department with any of 
these diagnoses:
a. HF
b."
7146,"Stable angina
c. Arrhythmia
d. Atypical location of pain
e. Central nervous system manifestations (symptoms of

7147,MIs may present differently in women.
7148,a.
7149,"Women are more likely than men to present without 
chest pain (42% vs 30.7%)."
7150,b.
7151,"Women often report prodromal symptoms, such as 
fatigue, dyspnea, and insomnia."
7152,"c. Dyspnea, weakness, and fatigue are common presenting 
symptoms."
7153,"d. Gender-based differences becomes less pronounced as 
patients age (ie, both men and woman present more 
frequently without chest pain)."
7154,e. Risk Stratification.
7155,"Given the wide array of atypical 
presentations for ACS and the risks involved in a 
missed diagnosis, risk stratification tools have been 
developed and tested to help risk stratify patients 
and support clinical decision making such as the 
TIMI and HEART scores discussed in the section 
on unstable angina."
7156,MI can present in many different ways.
7157,"A high 
index of suspicion should always be present."
7158,"MI is most likely misdiagnosed in certain 
groups of patients (elderly, women, minorities, 
those with diabetes)."

1."
7171,"Primary PCI with stent placement is the most efficacious 
treatment."
7172,2.
7173,"Both PCI and thrombolysis are most effective when 
completed within 12 hours of symptom onset."
7174,3.
7175,"PCI has lower mortality (even in patients who must 
be transferred—albeit quickly—to a hospital with the 
capability)
4."
7176,"PCI has significantly lower risk of serious bleeding 
complications, such as hemorrhagic stroke
5."
7177,"The ability to do primary PCI depends on the presence of 
an interventional cardiology team who can rapidly bring 
the patient to the catheterization laboratory."

to improve survival rate including
1."

1."
7186,Women who suffer an MI are more likely to die.
7187,"Recent 
data show an in-hospital mortality rate of 14.6% for 
women and 10.3% for men."
7188,2.
7189,"The cause of this disparity is multifactorial but includes the 
fact that patients without chest pain receive delayed and 
less aggressive care."
7190,3.
7191,"The mortality difference becomes less pronounced and 
eventually reverses with age."
7192,4.
7193,"An exercise test is also recommended within 3 weeks of 
an MI in patients not undergoing PCI or angiography for 
information on prognosis, functional capacity, and risk 
stratification."

Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, acute MI?"
7195,"Have 
you ruled out the active alternatives?"
7196,"Do 
other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
The ST depression is consistent with cardiac ischemia but does not 
satisfy the strict criteria for STEMI."
7197,"In addition, ST depression is 
less specific than ST elevation and does not conclusively make the 
diagnosis of an acute MI; the diagnosis will be confirmed when 
cardiac enzyme results become available."
7198,"The abnormal ECG cer -
tainly makes the alternative diagnosis, UA, quite likely if MI is 
excluded."
7199,"Aortic dissections also can cause cardiac ischemia, so this 
too must remain on the differential."
7200,"Alternative Diagnosis: UA or nSTEMI

toms of CHD and are only differentiated by the absence (UA) or 
presence (nSTEMI) of myocardial enzyme elevation in peripheral

7231,"Rest angina
2."
7232,"New-onset (< 2 months) angina
3."
7233,"Increasing, or accelerating, angina
B."
7234,"The American College of Cardiology and American Heart 
Association have endorsed a number of features or findings

7242,"D. Clinical risk scores can be helpful for stratifying patient 
cardiac risk."
7243,"The TIMI score (Table 9-8) for UA/nSTEMI is 
probably the most widely known of these scores."
7244,"It was orig -
inally derived from a cohort of patients receiving treatment 
for ACS and thus should not be applied to patients with

Mr. H is a 31-year-old man, previously in excellent health, 
who arrives at the emergency department complaining of 
chest pain."
7366,He reports that the pain began 10 days earlier.
7367,It was initially mild but has become more severe.
7368,"The pain is 
accompanied by mild cough and shortness of breath."
7369,"Five 
days earlier, he came to the emergency department and 
was diagnosed with costochondritis; he was given an NSAID 
and discharged."
7370,"Since then the pain has become more severe and has 
become pleuritic."
7371,"He says it is located over the right lateral 
lower chest wall."
7372,"He reports associated mild dyspnea and 
low-grade fevers with temperatures as high as 38°C."
7373,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
7374,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
7375,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
This is a healthy young man with a subacute illness."
7376,"He reports 
pleuritic chest pain, cough, dyspnea, and fevers."
7377,"Because his pain 
is subacute we refer back to Figure 9-1."
7378,"The first important point 
is to consider whether his presentation is consistent with stable 
angina."
7379,"Given his demographics and presentation, CAD would be 
a very unlikely cause for his symptoms."
7380,"Given this patient’s low CAD risk, we next consider common 
causes of chest pain, such as musculoskeletal or esophageal causes."
7381,"This is likely the diagnostic pathway followed by Mr. H’s physician 
5 days ago when costochondritis was diagnosed."
7382,"However, today 
the presentation also includes a fever and dyspnea, symptoms not 
associated with musculoskeletal chest wall syndromes or GERD."
7383,"At this point it is important to consider causes of chest pain 
associated with fever."
7384,"Infectious diseases that could cause pleuritic 
chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever will certainly lead this 
list."
7385,"Pneumonia or pleural effusion could cause these symptoms, 
either individually or as part of the same process."
7386,"(Pleural effu -
sions will be discussed below while pneumonia will be discussed 
in Chapter 10.)"
7387,"Pericarditis can also cause pleuritic chest pain and 
can be associated with fevers."
7388,"When severe, the pleurisy of pericar -
ditis may be experienced as dyspnea by the patient."
7389,"PE is a classic 
cause of pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath and may be 
associated with low-grade fever (see Chapter 15)."
7390,"Intra-abdominal 
processes, such as subdiaphragmatic abscess should also be kept in 
mind as causes of pleuritic chest pain."
7391,"The combination of fever, 
dyspnea, and chest pain places pneumonia or pleural effusion at 
the top of the list."
7392,Table 9-11 lists the differential diagnosis.
7393,"3
During further history taking, Mr. H reports no radiation 
of the pain."
7394,"He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or 
change in appetite."
7395,"Deep breathing and sudden movements 
worsen the pain."
7396,"There are no other palliative or provocative 
features."
7397,"On physical exam, Mr. H is a healthy appearing man who is 
in mild distress."
7398,He moves gingerly because of the pain and he is dyspneic.
7399,He coughs occasionally during the history.
7400,This causes great pain.
7401,"Vital signs are temperature, 38.9°C; 
BP , 130/84 mm Hg; pulse, 110 bpm; RR, 26 breaths per 
minute."
7402,"Head and neck exam is normal; there is no jugular 
venous distention."
7403,"Lung exam is notable for dullness to per -
cussion and decreased breath sounds at the right base."
7404,"There is an area of egophony just superior to the decreased 
breath sounds and normal breath sounds superior to this."
7405,The left chest is clear.
7406,"Heart exam is normal as are the 
abdomen and extremities."
7407,"A 12-lead ECG reveals sinus 
tachycardia without PR depression or ischemic changes."
7408,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"
7409,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
7410,"Leading Hypothesis: Pleural Effusion
T extbook Presentation
Small effusions are usually asymptomatic while large effusions 
reliably cause dyspnea with or without pleuritic chest pain."
7411,"The 
presentation depends on the cause of the effusion."
7412,"Parapneumonic 
effusions are accompanied by the signs and symptoms of pneumo -
nia while effusions related to neoplasm, HF , PE or rheumatologic 
disease are accompanied by signs of those underlying diseases."
7413,"Disease Highlights
A. Pathophysiology of pleural effusions vary by etiology but may 
be due to one or any combination of the following disruptions

7482,"Determining the etiology of a pleural effusion
1."
7483,"Any clinically significant effusion (> 1 cm on a chest film) 
should be sampled via thoracentesis; the only exception is 
in the case of HF ."
7484,a.
7485,"If the clinical suspicion for HF as the sole cause of the 
effusion is high, the effusion can be observed while the 
patient is treated."

7487,"If the effusion persists or the diagnosis becomes 
uncertain, the effusion should then be sampled."
7488,"Pleural effusions are abnormal; any new pleural 
effusion should be evaluated."
7489,2.
7490,"The first step in determining the cause of an effusion is to 
differentiate transudative from exudative effusions."
7491,a.
7492,"The Light criteria are the most widely used test for 
differentiating transudative from exudative effusions."
7493,"By 
these criteria, an effusion is considered to be an exudate 
if any of the following are present:
(1) Pleural fluid protein/serum protein > 0.5(2) Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LD)/serum 
LD > 0.6
(3) Pleural fluid LD > two-thirds upper limit of normal 
for serum LD
b."
7494,"The test characteristics for Light criteria are
(1) Sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 83%
(2) LR+, 5.76; LR−, 0.02
c. The most specific test for an exudative effusion is a 
difference between the serum albumin and pleural fluid 
albumin of < 1.2 g/dL (LR+ 10.88)."
7495,3.
7496,"Once the diagnosis of a transudate or exudate is made,

(3) Esophageal rupture
c. Cell count
(1) Neutrophil count over 50% argues for an acute

The patient’s physical exam findings are consistent with a 
pleural effusion."
7534,"A posteroanterior, lateral, and decubitus 
chest film were done that revealed an effusion."
7535,"The effu -
sion was aspirated and yielded pale, turbid fluid."
7536,"The ini -
tial results are glucose, < 20 mg/dL; LD, 38,400 units/L; 
protein, 4.4 g/dL; fluid pH, 6.2; RBC, 3200/mcL; WBC, 
144,000/mcL; Gram stain positive for gram-positive cocci 
in pairs and chains."
7537,"Serum values at the time included total 
protein of 7.8 g/dL and LD of 141 units/L."
7538,"Blood cultures, 
sputum cultures, and urine strep antigen testing were also 
ordered."
7539,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, pleural effusion?"
7540,"Have 
you ruled out the active alternatives?"
7541,"Do 
other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"
7542,Mr. H has a pleural effusion.
7543,"Given the size of the effusion on the 
chest film, a thoracentesis was clearly indicated."
7544,"The results of the 
aspirate are diagnostic."
7545,"The fluid is an exudate and the low glucose, 
low pH, high WBC, and positive Gram stain make the diagnosis 
of an empyema."
7546,"It is worth noting that Mr. H’s previous diagnosis of muscu -
loskeletal chest pain was incorrect."
7547,"A chest radiograph done on his 
previous visit to the emergency department may have made the 
correct diagnosis and treatment could, potentially, have prevented 
the development of an empyema."
7548,"Chest films can be instrumen -
tal in identifying soft tissue, skeletal, pulmonary, and mediastinal 
causes of chest pain."
7549,"In fact, over 20% of chest radiographs reveal 
findings that change or determine the course of treatment for 
patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain."
7550,"A chest film should be performed in any 
patient with chest pain and no clear diagnosis."

7573,Chest pain is almost always present.
7574,2.
7575,The pain is usually pleuritic.
7576,3.
7577,It classically radiates to the trapezius ridge.
7578,4.
7579,Pain improves with sitting and worsens with reclining.
7580,"C. Physical exam
1."
7581,"The pericardial friction rub is insensitive but nearly 100% 
specific; it is diagnostic of pericarditis."
7582,2.
7583,The rub is usually triphasic.
7584,"a. T riphasic in 58% of cases
b. Biphasic in 24% of cases
c. Monophasic in 18% of cases
3."
7585,Pericarditis is usually complicated by a pericardial effusion.
7586,"Although the physical exam is insensitive for pericardial 
effusions, it is good for detecting tamponade."
7587,a.
7588,"Sensitivity of jugular venous distention to detect 
tamponade is 100%."

(1) Sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 83%
(2) LR+, 5.9; LR−, 0.03
d. Beck triad (hypotension, jugular venous distention, and 
the presence of muffled heart sounds) is seldom seen but 
is very specific for tamponade."
7592,4.
7593,"ECG
a."
7594,"The ECG most commonly shows widespread ST 
elevations and PR depressions."
7595,"This finding is highly 
specific, but the sensitivity is only about 60%."
7596,b.
7597,"The differentiation of pericarditis from acute MI on 
ECG can be difficult."
7598,"Some of the key differentiating 
factors are
(1) ST elevation in pericarditis is usually diffuse while 
in MI it is localized to leads associated with the area 
of ischemia/infarction."
7599,"(2) ST elevations in MI are often associated with 
reciprocal changes."
7600,(3) PR depression is very uncommon in acute MI.
7601,(4) Q waves are not present with pericarditis.
7602,Pericarditis can mimic MI.
7603,"The presence of a 
rub and careful analysis of the ECG should 
enable their distinction.FP5."
7604,"Other diagnostic tests
a."
7605,"An echocardiogram is always done when pericarditis 
has been diagnosed to evaluate the presence of a 
significant pericardial effusion and exclude the presence 
of tamponade."

therefore not helpful for distinguishing the chest pain of 
pericarditis from that of cardiac ischemia."
7607,"D. Determining the etiology of pericarditis

7608,"Because most pericarditis is either idiopathic or viral, 
requiring only supportive care, extensive work-up is

refractory or recurrent disease."
7615,"Even the most invasive 
diagnostic studies, pericardiocentesis and pericardial biopsy, 
are generally not helpful."
7616,"Their diagnostic yield is only 
about 20%."
7617,"Treatment
A."
7618,"Because most patients have viral or idiopathic disease, the 
treatment of acute pericarditis is supportive."
7619,1.
7620,"NSAIDs are the treatment of choice, usually providing 
good pain relief."
7621,2.
7622,"The addition of colchicine may improve response to 
therapy and decrease rates of recurrent disease."
7623,"B. Prednisone is effective in patients with refractory disease but 
only after excluding the presence of diseases (such as TB) that 
could be worsened by corticosteroids."
7624,C. Pericardiocentesis is required in patients with tamponade.
7625,"CASE RESOLUTION

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Ms. L is a 22-year-old woman who comes to your office in 
November complaining of cough and fever."
7740,"What is the differential diagnosis of acute 
cough and congestion?"
7741,"How would you frame 
the differential?"
7742,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of acute cough and congestion ranges 
from trivial self-limited upper respiratory viral infections to seri -
ous, imminently life-threatening pneumonia."
7743,"Importantly, there 
are many causes of pneumonia that need to be identified in order 
to make an accurate diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment."

and Congestion

4."
7749,"T uberculosis (TB)
5."
7750,"Opportunistic (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia [PJP])
The approach to such patients focuses on 2 pivotal questions."
7751,"First, 
does the patient have symptoms, signs, or risk factors for pneumo -
nia that warrant a chest radiograph or other evaluation?"
7752,"Second, 
in patients with pneumonia, is it a CAP vs. another type of pneu -
monia (such as PJP , aspiration pneumonia, TB, etc.)"
7753,"that requires 
additional diagnostic evaluation and/or treatment?"
7754,"PATIENT  1
Ms. L reports that she was in her usual state of health until 
5 days ago when a cough developed."
7755,"There was no associ -
ated sore throat, rhinitis, myalgias or headache."
7756,"Two days ago, a low-grade fever (37.8°C) developed, which increased 
last night to 38.8°C."
7757,"She reports that her sputum is yellow 
and that she has no chest pain or shortness of breath."
7758,"How reliable is the history and physical exam 
for detecting pneumonia?"
7759,A.
7760,"The diagnosis of pneumonia is usually based on clinical find -
ings (cough, fever, crackles), accompanied by infiltrate on 
chest film."
7761,Microbiologic confirmation is usually unnecessary.
7762,B.
7763,"When evaluating a patient who has acute respiratory symptoms 
it is imperative to determine who is likely to have pneumonia 
and therefore needs a radiograph to evaluate their symptoms."
7764,"C. Prevalence of symptoms in patients with pneumonia
1."
7765,"Cough, 96%
2."
7766,"Fever, 81% but 53% in the elderly
Elderly patients with pneumonia often do not   
have a fever."
7767,"Clinicians should have a low

7773,No single finding is very sensitive.
7774,"Therefore, the absence of 
any single finding does not rule out pneumonia (Table 10-1)."
7775,a.
7776,"Neither a normal lung exam nor the absence of fever 
rule out pneumonia (LR–, 0.6 and 0.8, respectively)."
7777,A normal lung exam does not  rule out pneumonia.

exam make pneumonia highly unlikely (sensitivity, 
95%; LR–, 0.09)."
7781,"Normal vital signs and a normal lung exam 
make pneumonia unlikely.I have a patient with acute respiratory  
complaints of cough and congestion."
7782,How do I determine the cause?

2."
7784,"Egophony is fairly specific and significantly increases the 
likelihood of pneumonia when present (LR+, 8.6)."
7785,"In summary, there are signs and symptoms that suggest pneumo -
nia because they are unusual in upper respiratory tract infections or 
bronchitis."
7786,"These include dyspnea, high fever (with the exception 
of influenza [see below]), altered mental status, hypoxia, hypoten -
sion, and abnormal findings on chest examination (dullness to 
percussion, crackles, decreased breath sounds, bronchophony, or 
egophony)."
7787,"Any patient with such symptoms or signs requires 
a chest radiograph to rule out pneumonia."
7788,"A chest radiograph 
should also be strongly considered in patients at increased risk for 
poor outcomes, including immunocompromised patients, elderly 
patients, patients with heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (in whom abnor -
mal lung findings are also more difficult to appreciate)."
7789,"On the 
other hand, patients with normal vital signs, a normal lung exam 
and who are not at risk for poor outcomes do not normally need a 
chest radiograph."
7790,"Figure 10-1 shows a diagnostic algorithm illus -
trating the initial approach to patients with cough and congestion."
7791,"In patients discovered to have pneumonia, the next pivotal step 
is to determine the likely etiologic pathogen(s) to ensure patients 
receive appropriate therapy."
7792,"While most patients seen in the com -
munity with pneumonia have community-acquired pneumonia 
(due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Legionella,  
and others), it is important to realize that many patients from the 
community  have other types of pneumonia (ie, aspiration pneumo -
nia, influenza pneumonia, TB pneumonia, etc.)"
7793,"caused by other 
pathogens that require different/additional antimicrobial therapy."
7794,"A careful review of both the patient’s risk factors and chest radio -
graph often provide critical clues that suggest additional microor -
ganisms needing evaluation and antibiotic coverage (Figure 10-2)."
7795,"Pneumonia in patients with known  immunocompromise will 
not be covered in this chapter (known HIV, transplant recipients, 
and patients with granulocytopenia)."

differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
7803,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As noted above, the initial differential diagnosis of acute cough 
and fever includes acute bronchitis, influenza, and pneumonia."
7804,"Like many real-life patients, this patient’s clinical picture is not 
typical for any of these conditions."
7805,"Acute bronchitis may cause 
a cough and low-grade fever but 38.8°C is unusual."
7806,"Pneumonia 
could clearly cause a cough and fever but is often associated with 
an abnormal lung exam."
7807,"Influenza often causes cough and fever, 
(and a normal lung exam) but the subacute onset of fever and lack 
of other upper respiratory symptoms is unusual."
7808,"It is also early in 
the season for influenza."
7809,"Nonetheless, you decide that influenza is 
the leading hypothesis with acute bronchitis and pneumonia being 
active alternatives."
7810,"Given the clinical uncertainty, a chest film and 
nasopharyngeal swab for influenza are ordered."
7811,"Table 10-2 lists the 
differential diagnosis."
7812,"Leading Hypothesis: Influenza
T extbook Presentation
Although there is a wide range of severity of influenza symptoms, 
patients typically complain of a severe, febrile, respiratory illness 
that begins abruptly."
7813,"The onset is often abrupt (“like being hit by a 
train”), associated with severe myalgias (even their eyes hurt when 
they look around), diffuse pain (they may complain that their hair 
or skin hurts), respiratory symptoms (cough, rhinitis, pharyngi -
tis), and high fever (occasionally as high as 40–41°C) that peaks 
within 12 hours."

respiratory symptoms (dyspnea) and signs (cough, chest pain, 
and crackles), and infiltrate on chest film."
8095,B.
8096,"However, patients often lack 1 or more of these elements."
8097,"C. As noted in Table 10-1 neither the absence of fever nor a 
normal lung exam individually rules out pneumonia (LR–, 
0.6–0.8), so clinicians must maintain a high level of vigilance."
8098,"However, the absence of both fever and abnormal lung find -
ings makes the diagnosis unlikely (LR–, 0.08)."

anterior-posterior chest film has a lower sensitivity than 
posteroanterior and lateral views (59% vs 90%)."
8104,"Posteroanterior and lateral chest film views are 
superior to single anterior-posterior views and 
should be obtained when possible."
8105,"Stern_ch10_p173-p200.indd   181 22/07/19   12:08 pm182 / CHAPTER 10
c. False-negative chest films were more common in patients 
with crackles on exam or a high C-reactive protein."
8106,"A normal chest radiograph does not rule out 
pneumonia when the pretest probability is 
high (ie, a patient with cough, fever, and 
crackles)."
8107,"Such patients should still receive 
antibiotics."

HIV-infected persons."
8400,"(2) However, with the advent of antiretroviral therapy 
and PJP prophylaxis, the incidence of PJP has 
dropped dramatically among HIV-infected persons 
(> 10×) and the majority of PJP cases now occur in 
non–HIV-infected immunocompromised persons."
8401,"b. Non–HIV-infected patients:
(1) PJP may occur in patients who are receiving 
corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or other 
immunosuppressive therapies."
8402,"(2) PJP may also occur in patients with idiopathic CD4 
lymphocytopenia
(3) Unlike HIV-infected patients, these patients often 
have a higher mean CD4 count when PJP develops 
(mean 302–487 cells/mcL)."
8403,"A CD4 count > 200 cells/mcL does not rule out 
PJP in non–HIV-immunosuppressed persons."
8404,"(4) Non–HIV-infected persons with PJP also experience 
higher mortality from PJP than HIV-infected 
persons (30–60% vs. 7%) probably secondary to a 
delay in diagnosis."

than 2 weeks
(4) Any AIDS defining illness
b. Non–HIV-infected immunocompromised patients:
(1) Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 
those receiving solid organ or allogeneic bone 
marrow transplantation (NNT 19)."
8497,"(2) A Cochrane Review also recommended prophylaxis 
for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis

restore the CD4 count and allow for discontinuation 
of prophylaxis when CD4 count > 200 cells/mcL for 
approximately 3 months (unless PJP developed in patients 
with CD4 counts above 200 cells/mcL)."

a."
8579,"4–6% of patients with latent TB infection experience 
reactivation during their lifetime."
8580,"The greatest risk is in 
the first 2 years following infection."
8581,b. Reactivation is often due to declining immune function.
8582,"Risk factors include HIV, immunosuppressive therapy, 
diabetes mellitus, and silicosis."
8583,"Children are also at 
higher risk."
8584,"c. Reactivation TB results in 90% of adult non–AIDS-
related TB."

born persons, they account for 71% of cases or 
reactivation TB."
8586,"e. Symptoms are usually insidious and include chronic 
cough, weight loss, night sweats, anorexia, and low- or 
high-grade fevers."

8603,"Symptoms
a."
8604,No symptom is terribly sensitive for TB.
8605,"Weight loss 
and cough for > 2 weeks increase the likelihood of TB 
more significantly than night sweats or hemoptysis."

8607,c. Fever is present in only 55%.
8608,"d. Other clues may include lack of systemic toxicity or 
failure to respond to antibacterial therapy."
8609,"Patients with TB may complain primarily of 
weight loss or night sweats and have a normal 
lung exam."
8610,"Fever and hemoptysis may be 
absent."
8611,"Pulmonary TB still needs to be consid -
ered in such patients."
8612,"e. Symptoms and risk factors for disease tend to vary 
between older patients who often have reactivation TB 
and younger patients in whom primary TB is more 
common."
8613,"Compared with older patients, younger 
patients have a higher incidence of alcoholism (66% vs 
37%)."
8614,"In addition, younger patients more frequently 
have fever (62% vs 31%), night sweats (48% vs 6%), 
and hemoptysis (40% vs 17%)."

8854,"C. Pneumonia in such patients is often secondary to multidrug- 
resistant organisms, including MRSA and gram-negative 
bacilli including P aeruginosa."
8855,"They may also be infected with 
organisms that commonly cause CAP ( S pneumoniae  and 
H influenzae )."
8856,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
8857,"The diagnosis of pneumonia is typically made clinically by the 
presence of a new lung infiltrate and ≥ 2 of the following: fever 
> 38°C, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and purulent secretions."
8858,B.
8859,A lower respiratory tract culture is recommended.
8860,"Samples 
may include expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or 
samples from bronchoscopy (BAL or protected brush speci -
men)."
8861,"Endotracheal aspirate is preferred in ventilated patients 
and sputum culture in nonventilated patients."
8862,"C. Blood cultures are recommended for patients with hospital- 
acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia."
8863,"Treatment
A. Antimicrobial coverage is designed to cover S aureus, P aerug -
inosa,  and other gram-negative bacteria."
8864,B.
8865,"The 2016 IDSA guidelines recommend coverage of S aureus, 
P aeruginosa,  and gram-negative bacilli for all patients with 
hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneu -
monia."
8866,"Extended coverage should be given to patients with an 
increased risk for antibiotic resistance or at an increased risk 
of death."
8867,1.
8868,"An increased risk of resistance should be assumed in areas 
with a > 10–20% local resistance on antibiogram, in 
patients receiving antibiotics within the preceding 90 days, 
and those hospitalized for ≥ 5 days prior to pneumonia."
8869,2.
8870,"An increased risk of mortality should be assumed for 
patients with septic shock, those requiring ventilator 
support, or new-onset renal replacement therapy.3."
8871,"Extended coverage includes vancomycin or linezolid 
for possible MRSA infection and 2 antipseudomonal 
antibiotics."
8872,4.
8873,"Aerosolized antibiotics in addition to IV antibiotics may be 
useful in select patients."
8874,5.
8875,"Culture data and susceptibility should guide antimicrobial 
therapy when it becomes available."
8876,"Pertussis
T extbook Presentation
The typical adult with pertussis presents with “viral type” upper 
respiratory infection symptoms of nonproductive cough, rhinor -
rhea, sore throat, and sneezing."
8877,"However, instead of resolving over 
3–7 days, the cough persists and is paroxysmal, often severe and 
occasionally even terminates in posttussive emesis."
8878,"Whooping, a 
deep inspiration at the end of a cough, is unusual in adults."
8879,"Disease Highlights
A."
8880,"The average incubation period is 7–10 days but may be 28 
days or longer."
8881,B.
8882,Half of pertussis cases occur in adolescents and adults.
8883,C. Spread by aerosol droplets.
8884,"Develops in about one-third of 
household contacts."
8885,"D. Typically occurs in 3 stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and chronic."
8886,1.
8887,Catarrhal stage lasts 1–2 weeks.
8888,a.
8889,"Typical symptoms include rhinitis, lacrimation, sore 
throat, coughing, and sneezing."
8890,b.
8891,The cough is usually mild.
8892,c. Fever is absent or low grade.
8893,2.
8894,"Paroxysmal phase begins in the second week with fits of 
5–10 or more forceful coughs (paroxysms) in an otherwise 
well-appearing patient."
8895,a.
8896,"A deep inspiration may occur at the end of coughing 
(the “whoop”)."
8897,b. Emesis may occur at the end of coughing.
8898,c. Can last 2–3 months (the chronic phase).
8899,d. The cough may be severe and prevent sleeping.
8900,"e. Unusual complications from coughing in adults include 
hernia, pneumothorax, rib fracture, and weight loss."
8901,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
8902,"Among patients with cough lasting > 6–7 days, the prevalence 
of pertussis is 3–20%; however, the likelihood increases in 
adult patients with acute cough lasting > 3 weeks (12–32%)."
8903,B.
8904,The median duration of cough is 42 days (27–66 days).

8929,"Without postexposure 
prophylaxis, the secondary attack rate is > 80% among 
susceptible persons."
8930,"c. Infected patients should avoid contact with young 
children and infants and working in healthcare facilities 
for at least 5 days after starting antibiotics."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1 
Mr. B is a previously healthy 70-year-old man who under -
went right upper lobectomy for localized squamous cell lung 
cancer 5 days ago."
9111,"On morning rounds, he comments that 
he is in a military barracks and that he is ready to go home."
9112,"What is the differential diagnosis of delirium 
and dementia?"
9113,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
9114,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Delirium and dementia are both syndromes of neurologic dysfunc -
tion that present as a “change in mental status.” Since the term 
“altered mental status” can be broad, categorizing the change as 
chronic or acute and then further classifying acute changes as fluc -
tuating or nonfluctuating may be helpful (Figure 11-1)."
9115,"A patient 
whose mental status change is acute may have either fluctuating 
or nonfluctuating symptoms."
9116,"A patient with acute, fluctuating 
mental status change is probably delirious."
9117,"A patient with an acute 
but stable mental status change may have delirium but may also 
have a long list of other central nervous system (CNS) insults (head 
trauma, CNS infection, hypoglycemia, cerebrovascular accident 
[CVA] among others)."
9118,"Chronic mental change is caused by an irre -
versible change to the CNS, such as dementia, chronic psychiatric 
disease, or long-standing CNS injury."
9119,Delirium and dementia are thus very different syndromes.
9120,"Delirium is acute, usually reversible, and nearly always has an 
underlying, non-neurologic etiology."
9121,"Dementia is chronic and sel -
dom reversible."
9122,"The definition of delirium from the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,  5e (DSM- 5) is:
A."
9123,"A disturbance in attention (ie, reduced ability to direct, focus, 
sustain, and shift attention) and awareness (reduced orienta -
tion to the environment)."
9124,B.
9125,"The disturbance develops over a short period of time, rep -
resents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and 
tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day."
9126,"C. An additional disturbance in cognition (eg, memory deficit, 
disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception)."
9127,"D. The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained 
by another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive 
disorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced 
level of arousal, such as coma."
9128,"E. There is evidence from the history, physical exam, or labo -
ratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiologic consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxica -
tion or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multi -
ple etiologies."
9129,"The DSM -5 defines dementia as a major neurocognitive disor -
der and then defines the many underlying diseases."
9130,"The definition 
of a major cognitive disorder is:
A."
9131,"Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a previous level 
of performance in 1 or more cognitive domains (complex 
attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, 
perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on:
1."
9132,"Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, 
or the clinician that there has been a significant decline in 
cognitive function; and
2."
9133,"A substantial impairment in cognitive performance, 
preferably documented by standardized neuropsychological 
testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical 
assessment."
9134,B.
9135,"The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday 
activities (ie, at a minimum, requiring assistance with complex 
instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs] such as paying 
bills or managing medications)."
9136,"C. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context 
of a delirium."
9137,"D. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by 
another mental disorder (eg, major depressive disorder, 
schizophrenia)."
9138,"Because almost any illness can cause delirium in a susceptible 
patient, the differential diagnosis of delirium is long and needs to 
consider a broad range of illnesses, comorbidities, and medication 
effects."
9139,The differential diagnosis of dementia is more finite.
9140,"Dis -
orders have been listed in order of their approximate prevalence as 
etiologic factors."
9141,"A. Delirium

A."
9195,Almost any illness can lead to delirium in a susceptible patient.
9196,B. Delirium often complicates medical or surgical hospitalizations.
9197,"C. The most important clues to delirium are the acuity of onset 
and the fluctuation of course."
9198,"D. Delirium most commonly occurs in older persons and in 
patients with underlying neurologic disease."
9199,There is always a cause of delirium.
9200,"Clinicians 
must recognize delirium and identify the cause."
9201,E. Several conditions are more likely to cause delirium than others.

the age of 65."
9208,1.
9209,"10% of emergency department patients
2."
9210,"12–25% of medical patients
3."
9211,"20–50% of surgical patients (highest in patients after hip 
replacement)
Most acutely ill, older patients who have an 
acute deterioration in mental status are suffer -
ing from delirium."
9212,G. The prognosis of delirium is poor.
9213,1.
9214,"Although reliable data is difficult to obtain, delirium is a 
predictor of poor outcomes."
9215,2.
9216,"Meta-analysis shows that, after controlling for age, sex, 
comorbid illness or illness severity, and baseline dementia, 
patients who experienced delirium had a higher risk of death, 
institutionalization, and dementia during follow-up."
9217,a.
9218,"The mortality rate, over about 2 years, for patients in 
whom delirium developed was 38%."
9219,b.
9220,"The rate of institutionalization, over about a year, was 
33.4%."
9221,"c. The rate of developing dementia over the next 4 years 
was 62.5%."
9222,3.
9223,"In this same study, patients with dementia and delirium 
had the highest risk of death."
9224,H. Delirium is often persistent.
9225,"Many studies show that most 
patients in whom delirium develops have at least some persis -
tent symptoms at discharge."
9226,"These symptoms may be present 
for months."
9227,"Only a small percentage of patients with delir -
ium have complete resolution of symptoms 
with treatment of the underlying disease and 
return home."
9228,I. Delirium can occasionally “unmask” underlying dementia.
9229,"This occurs when a patient with a mild, undiagnosed demen -
tia becomes delirious in the hospital and is then evaluated 
more fully for cognitive impairment."

Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Pretest probability
1."
9231,Predictors of delirium have been identified.
9232,"These help 
provide pretest probabilities."
9233,2.
9234,"One study developed a model to determine a patient’s risk of 
delirium developing while in the hospital."
9235,"Predictors included:
a."
9236,"Vision impairment
b."
9237,"Severe illness
c. Cognitive impairment
d. High blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio
3."
9238,"In a patient population with a mean age of 78, the number 
of risk factors present correlated with the risk of developing 
delirium."
9239,a.
9240,No risk factors: 3% chance of delirium developing.
9241,b.
9242,1 or 2 risk factors: 14% chance of delirium developing.
9243,c. 3 or 4 risk factors: 26% chance of delirium developing.
9244,4.
9245,"Several predictors from another study, with ORs for 
association with delirium, are listed below:
a. Abnormal sodium level (OR 6.2)
b."
9246,"Severe illness (OR 5.9)
c. Chronic cognitive impairment (OR 5.3)
d. Hypothermia or hyperthermia (OR 5.0)
e. Moderate illness (OR 4.0)
f. Psychoactive drug use (OR 3.9)
g. Azotemia (OR 2.9)
Consider a patient’s risk of delirium upon 
hospital admission; an accurate identification 
of risk can prompt intervention to lessen the 
likelihood of delirium and allow more rapid 
intervention if delirium does occur."
9247,B.
9248,"Diagnosis
1."
9249,"In general, a routine exam is specific but insensitive for the 
diagnosis of delirium."
9250,2.
9251,Multiple tools have been developed to diagnose delirium.
9252,3.
9253,"The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is the best-
validated and most widely used tool for diagnosing 
delirium."
9254,4.
9255,"The CAM is considered positive when a patient fulfills 
both criteria a and b as well as either c or d:
a."
9256,"The mental status change is of acute onset and 
fluctuating course."
9257,b.
9258,There is inattention.
9259,"The patient has difficulty focusing 
his attention (being easily distracted or having trouble 
following a conversation)."
9260,c. There is disorganized thinking.
9261,"The patient’s thinking 
is disorganized or incoherent (such as rambling or 
irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, 
or unpredictable switching from subject to subject)."
9262,d. There is an altered level of consciousness.
9263,"This can be 
anything other than alert (vigilant, lethargic, stuporous)."
9264,5.
9265,"The test characteristics for the CAM are good and surpass 
those of an unaided physician assessment."
9266,"a. CAM: sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 93%; LR+, 12.3; 
LR–, 0.15.
b."
9267,"Physician evaluation (in the emergency department): 
sensitivity, 17–35%; specificity, 98–100; LR+, 8.5–∞; 
LR–, 0.65–0.85.6."
9268,"The CAM-S is a validated tool, based on CAM, to assess 
the severity of the diagnosed delirium."
9269,a.
9270,"There are 4- and 10-item versions of the CAM-S; the 
higher the score, the more severe the delirium."
9271,b.
9272,"Increasing scores predict longer hospital length of stay, 
worse functional decline, and higher 90-day mortality."
9273,"C. Etiology
1."
9274,"Because delirium is a symptom and not a disease, once a 
diagnosis of delirium is made, it is necessary to identify the 
cause."
9275,2.
9276,"The initial evaluation of the patient involves a review of the 
most common causes of delirium."
9277,"a. Repeat a physical exam, focusing on sources of infection."
9278,b.
9279,"Review medications in detail, including reconciling 
home and hospital medications."
9280,"Medication toxicity, even at therapeutic doses, 
is a common cause of delirium, particularly 
common in older patients."
9281,"Review all medica -
tions, especially psychoactive ones."
9282,"c. Always order basic laboratory tests, such as a complete 
blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel, liver 
biochemical tests, and urinalysis."
9283,"d. Consider other tests (based on the clinical situation) 
such as ECG, chest radiograph, pulse oximetry (with 
arterial blood gas [ABG] if the patient is at risk for CO2 
retention), and blood and urine cultures."
9284,3.
9285,"Uncommon causes
a."
9286,"If the initial workup is negative, is it usually reasonable 
to assume that the delirium is related to the acute 
illness?"
9287,"Evaluation for diseases that directly affect the 
CNS (eg, stroke, seizure, and meningitis or encephalitis) 
is seldom necessary."
9288,"(1) Stroke
(a) Very rare cause of delirium
(b) A robust study reported that only about 7% of 
cases of delirium are caused by stroke."
9289,"(c) 97% of these patients had focal abnormalities 
on a careful neurologic exam."
9290,"(2) Seizure
(a) Nonconvulsive seizures, such as temporal 
lobe epilepsy, are usually recognized by their 
intermittent nature."
9291,"(b) Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is very rare 
but is a potential cause of mental status change 
that could be confused with delirium."
9292,"Patients 
with nonconvulsive status epilepticus almost 
always have risk factors for seizures or abnormal 
eye movements (eye jerking, hippus, repeated 
blinking, persistent eye deviation)."
9293,"(3) Meningitis: Fever and mental status change may be 
the only presenting symptoms."
9294,b.
9295,"When evaluating a delirious patient, consider 
neuroimaging, EEG, and lumbar puncture only in 
certain conditions."
9296,"(1) Neuroimaging  is only necessary if delirium is 
associated with a focal neurologic exam or if there is 
a very high suspicion of a cerebrovascular event."
9297,"(2) EEG  is only necessary if there is no other 
explanation for delirium and the patient has risk 
factors for or signs of seizures."

delirium from 15% to 9.9% (number needed to treat ≅ 20)."
9305,3.
9306,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
published a guideline for the prevention of delirium."
9307,"Among the 13 recommendations were:
a."
9308,"Addressing cognitive impairment (such as providing 
stimuli to reorient patients)
b."
9309,"Paying attention to hydration status, constipation, and 
hypoxia
c. Focusing on preventing, identifying, and treating 
infection
d. Encouraging early mobility
e. Addressing sensory impairments (use of glasses and 
hearing aids, cerumen disimpaction)
f. Promoting good sleep patterns/sleep hygiene
B. T reatment
Once delirium occurs, the causes must be addressed and 
supportive measures must be instituted."

9342,"Patients with alcoholic hallucinosis usually have a clear 
sensorium (ie, they would perform well on CAM)."
9343,"This fact usually makes alcoholic hallucinosis easily 
distinguishable from delirium."
9344,D. Major withdrawal is synonymous with delirium tremens.
9345,1.
9346,Occurs in patients with history of severe alcohol abuse.
9347,2.

deficiency."
9355,3.
9356,"Wernicke encephalopathy may occur when a patient, who 
is thiamine deficient, receives intravenous glucose."

abuse."
9367,"(Cases of Wernicke encephalopathy have also 
occurred in association with hyperemesis gravidarum 
and following bariatric surgery)."
9368,2.
9369,"It is important to recognize that Wernicke encephalopathy 
usually presents with only 1 or 2 of the features of the 
classic triad."
9370,3.
9371,"Fluctuation that characterizes nonalcohol-related delirium 
is absent."
9372,4.
9373,"The diagnosis of Wernicke encephalopathy can be made if 
2 of the following 4 signs are present:
a. Dietary deficiencies (as evidenced by underweight, 
thiamine deficiency, or abnormal dietary history)
b."
9374,"Disorders of ocular movement (such as ophthalmoplegia,

9384,4.
9385,"Adrenergic overactivity (hypertension, tachycardia, fever) 
is always present unless masked by medications."
9386,"Every patient should have an alcohol history 
taken on admission."

particular needs of the patient."
9400,"(2) Benzodiazepines may either be given on a fixed-
scheduled or be given to treat symptoms."

strategies require careful patient monitoring and 
medication adjustment."
9402,"(3) The Addiction Research Foundation Clinical 
Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol 
(CIWA-Ar) developed a tool to predict the level of 
alcohol withdrawal."
9403,"(a) The tool scores the severity of symptoms in 
various categories such as tremor, anxiety, and 
sensory disturbances."
9404,"(b) A higher score (> 8–12) generally calls for active 
pharmacologic management, whether using a 
fixed-dose or symptom-triggered protocol."
9405,(c) Printable versions of the tool are available online.
9406,"(4) Fixed-schedule therapy
(a) Delivers regular fixed doses of benzodiazepines."
9407,"(b) Careful monitoring is still required to avoid 
undertreatment or oversedation."
9408,"(c) Fixed-schedule therapy may provide a slight 
margin of safety if careful monitoring cannot be 
performed adequately."
9409,"(5) Symptom-triggered therapy
(a) Avoids unnecessary medications in the group of 
patients who will not need them."
9410,"(b) Careful monitoring is required to avoid 
withdrawal and delirium tremens."
9411,"Careful monitoring and prompt patient-specific 
adjustment of benzodiazepine dose is the key to 
successful management of the alcoholic patient."

withdrawal."
9415,b.

sympathetic signs that alert the clinician to increasingly 
severe withdrawal, they increase the risk of inadequate 
use of benzodiazepines."

diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?"
9435,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mr. R has had a decline in cognitive status."
9436,"He has lost the 
ability to do a higher-level task."
9437,"Given the patient’s advanced age, 
dementia—most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD)—has to be 
included in the differential diagnosis of his cognitive decline."
9438,"The 
subacute onset of this patient’s symptoms makes AD the leading 
hypothesis."
9439,"Another common cause of dementia in older persons 
is vascular dementia (VaD)."
9440,"It will be important to determine 
whether this patient has risk factors for cerebrovascular disease."
9441,"In 
an older person, clinicians should also consider the normal cog -
nitive decline that comes with aging."
9442,"However, this never causes 
functional compromise."
9443,"An alternative diagnosis is mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), a syndrome of memory loss more severe than 
normal, age-related cognitive decline."
9444,"MCI also does not cause 
functional impairment."
9445,"Delirium and depression should always be 
considered in an older patient with cognitive decline because they 
are highly treatable."
9446,Table 11-2 lists the differential diagnosis.
9447,"A patient who is unable to successfully live 
independently because of cognitive issues 
always has an abnormality."
9448,"2
Mr. R’s past medical history is notable for chronic leg pain 
resulting from an injury during the war in Vietnam."
9449,"He also has 
gout."

9458,"Allopurinol, 300 mg daily
On examination, his vital signs are normal."
9459,"He answers 
about half the history questions himself but turns to his 
wife for assistance with details about doctors he has seen 
and the medications he takes."
9460,"He and his wife deny any 
symptoms of depression, although they note this has been 
a problem in the past."

Leading Hypothesis: AD
T extbook Presentation
Typically, a family member brings in an older patient because of 
confusion, memory loss, or personality change."
9469,"The patient may 
deny that a problem exists."
9470,"Detection of dementia during casual 
conversation may be difficult early in its course; more formal 
assessment is frequently necessary."
9471,"Disease Highlights
A."
9472,"AD most commonly occurs after the age of 65, although earlier 
presentations are possible."
9473,B.
9474,"Memory loss, behavioral or personality change, functional 
impairments, and social withdrawal are common early symptoms 
of AD."
9475,"C. Language disturbances
1."
9476,"In addition to those listed above, language disturbances are 
often present early in the course of the disease and often 
become severe with time."
9477,2.
9478,"Language disturbances may include fluent aphasia, paraphasia, 
and word substitutions."
9479,"D. Later in the course of the disease, global cognitive impairment 
develops, and patients become unable to independently 
accomplish the most basic activities of daily living (ADLs)."
9480,"Although present, memory loss may not be 
the presenting symptom in patients with AD; 
rather, behavioral or personality changes, 
functional impairments, social withdrawal, 
or language disturbances may be the initial 
symptoms."
9481,E. AD accounts for about 67% of cases of dementia.
9482,"F. Strictly speaking, the diagnosis of AD can only be made 
pathologically."
9483,"That said, the diagnosis of AD is always made 
clinically."
9484,"G. All definitions of AD include the deterioration in a person’s 
ability to function independently."
9485,"A patient’s level of function -
ing can be evaluated by assessing her ability to do the IADLs."
9486,1.
9487,"IADLs include
a."
9488,"Cooking
b."
9489,"House cleaning
c. Laundry
d. Management of medications
e. Management of the telephone
f. Management of personal accounts
g. Shopping
h. Use of transportation
2."
9490,"Late in the disease, a patient’s ability to perform the ADLs 
often becomes compromised."
9491,"These ADLs are
a."
9492,"Bathing
b."
9493,"Eating
c. Walking
d. Toileting and continence
e. Dressing
f. Grooming
H. The prognosis of AD is poor."
9494,1.
9495,"Estimates of median survival have traditionally ranged from 
5 years to 9 years with more recent data suggesting median 
survival close to 3 years with a range of 2.7 to 4 years.Table 11-3."
9496,Prevalence of dementia by age.
9497,"Prevalence
Age Outpatient Inpatient
65–75 2.1% 6.4%
> 75 11.7% 13%
> 85 — 31.2%2."
9498,Patients with advanced dementia do especially poorly.
9499,"In 
1 cohort of patients with advanced dementia who were 
monitored for 18 months, 54.8% died, 41.1% developed 
pneumonia, and 85.8% developed an eating problem."
9500,3.
9501,"Patients with AD also have a much worse prognosis after 
an acute illness."
9502,"In the same cohort, the 6-month mortality 
rate for patients who had pneumonia was 46.7%."
9503,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
9504,"Diagnosing AD can be challenging because patients often have 
subtle symptoms early in the disease course."
9505,1.
9506,"AD presents with self-reported memory loss in only a 
minority of patients."
9507,a.
9508,"Memory loss reported by a spouse, relative, or close 
friend is more predictive of dementia than self-reported 
memory loss."
9509,b.
9510,"Memory loss reported by a patient is still predictive 
dementia but may also be a sign of depression."
9511,2.
9512,"Behavioral changes and mood changes are commonly 
recognized by family members."
9513,3.
9514,"Clinicians may recognize behavioral changes such as 
increased anxiety, increased somatic complaints, or 
delusional thinking regarding illness as early symptoms of 
the disease."
9515,"Be aware that AD should be on the differential 
diagnosis of subtle behavioral changes in older 
patients."
9516,B.
9517,"The most efficient way to diagnose AD is to follow these 
3 steps:
1."
9518,Consider the probability that a patient has dementia.
9519,2.
9520,Diagnose dementia.
9521,3.
9522,"Diagnose AD by ruling out other causes of dementia and 
ensuring that the patient’s symptoms are consistent with AD."
9523,"C. Diagnosing dementia
1."
9524,"The prevalence of dementia in the older population is very 
high."
9525,The prevalence at different ages is given in Table 11-3.
9526,2.
9527,"Screening tests
a."
9528,Multiple tests are used to screen patients for dementia.
9529,"Three commonly used tests are the Mini-Mental Status 
Exam (MMSE), the Mini-Cog, and The Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)."
9530,"The Informant 
Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly 
(IQCODE) is a tool that uses information from a 
caregiver, family member, or friend."
9531,"(1) MMSE
(a) Most widely used test, scored out of 30
(b) Tests 5 domains and takes about 10 minutes to 
administer."
9532,"Stern_ch11_p201-p214.indd   208 11/07/19   5:18 pmDELIRIUM AND DEMENTIA  / 209
(2) Mini-Cog
(a) 3-item recall and clock drawing (which serves as 
the interference task)
(b) It is scored out of 5 (1 point for each item and 
2 points for a normal clock) and takes about 
3 minutes to administer."
9533,"(3) MoCA
(a) Initially developed and validated as a screening 
test for MCI."
9534,"(b) Tests 7 domains takes 10 minutes to administer 
and is scored out of 30."
9535,"(4) IQCODE
(a) Short form is a 16-item questionnaire."
9536,"(b) Takes about 10 minutes to complete, may be 
done by the informant during a patient visit, is 
scored by calculating an average score."
9537,b.
9538,"Test characteristics for these tests, taken from various 
Cochrane reviews, appear in Table 11-4."
9539,3.
9540,"Neuropsychiatric testing
a."
9541,"Considered the clinical gold standard for diagnosing 
dementia
b. Neuropsychiatric testing can be very helpful when the 
diagnosis of dementia is especially difficult."
9542,"c. Situations in which neuropsychiatric testing is commonly 
used are
(1) When there is disagreement between the clinical 
suspicion and in-office tests."
9543,"(2) To specifically gauge deficits in order to recommend 
ways of compensating."
9544,"(3) When present or suspected psychiatric disease 
(usually depression) complicates the diagnosis."
9545,"(4) When a more definitive diagnosis would be helpful 
for the patient or family members."
9546,"Neuropsychiatric testing is especially useful 
when in office testing is negative despite a high 
clinical suspicion of dementia."
9547,"D. The diagnosis of AD is clinical, based on the diagnosis of 
dementia and the presence of features consistent with AD."
9548,1.
9549,"Various office-based tests are useful in making this 
diagnosis."
9550,"The National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s 
Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-
ADRDA) criteria for probable AD are currently the most 
commonly used by specialists."

(1) Orientation
(2) Registration
(3) Visuospatial and executive functioning
(4) Language
(5) Attention and working memory
(6) Memory
c. Progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive 
functions
d. No disturbance of consciousness
e. Onset between ages 40 and 90, most often after age 65
f. Absence of other disorders that could account for the 
symptoms

9556,"The test characteristics for these criteria are:
a."
9557,"Sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 84%
b. LR+, 5.19; LR–, 0.2
4."
9558,"The NINCDS-ADRDA also gives factors that support the 
diagnosis."
9559,"These are very helpful clinically, although none 
are necessary to make the diagnosis."
9560,"Some of these are 
included below:
a."
9561,"Progressive deterioration of specific cognitive functions
(1) Aphasia
(2) Apraxia
(3) Agnosia
b."
9562,"Impaired ADLs and altered patterns of behavior
c. Family history of dementia
d. Normal lumbar puncture, normal or nonspecific EEG 
findings, and cerebral atrophy on neuroimaging
5."
9563,"Because these criteria are not perfect in the diagnosis of 
AD, patients in whom dementia or AD is suspected but 
who do not meet the criteria should be monitored closely 
or referred for more detailed neuropsychiatric testing."
9564,"E. Reversible dementias
1."
9565,"An important issue when diagnosing AD is how much 
more of a workup should be done?"
9566,"The concern is that 
when making a clinical diagnosis, potentially reversible 
dementias might be missed."
9567,"These reversible dementias 
include:
a. CNS infections
b. Hypothyroidism
c. Vitamin B12 deficiency
d. CNS masses
(1) Neoplasms
(2) Subdural hematomas
e. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
f. Medications
2."
9568,"Current practice is to order the following tests:
a. CBC
b. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
c. Basic metabolic panel and liver biochemical tests
d. Vitamin B12 level
e. Tests to exclude neurosyphilis
f. Consider neuroimaging (MRI or CT)

(1) Imaging is not required in most patients with 
dementia."
9569,"(2) In practice, most patients will undergo imaging 
both to assess for diagnoses other than AD and to 
detect brain atrophy that may support the diagnosis 
of AD."
9570,"Treatment
A. Counseling
1."
9571,"When the diagnosis of AD is made, patients and families 
should be educated on course, complications, and prognosis 
of the disease."
9572,2.
9573,"Decisions need to be made regarding health care proxies, 
financial and estate planning, and end-of-life care."
9574,3.
9575,"It is crucial to make these decisions while the patient is still 
a competent decision maker."
9576,"Referral to support services, 
such as the Alzheimer’s Association, may be helpful."
9577,4.
9578,"Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) is a validated tool 
helpful for identifying, tracking, and monitoring functional 
decline."
9579,"It is especially helpful to guide conversations about 
initiating hospice care."
9580,B.
9581,"Safety
1."
9582,"As dementia progresses, patient safety often becomes an 
issue."
9583,2.
9584,"Driving, wandering, and cooking are often early concerns."
9585,a.
9586,"Driving is usually the most difficult to address because 
patients lack insight into the dangers they pose and 
resist the loss of independence that not driving brings."
9587,b.
9588,"Physicians should raise this issue, since it is often 
difficult for caregivers to bring up."
9589,"c. Patients with even mild dementia should either be 
told to not drive or be required to undergo frequent 
performance evaluations."
9590,"d. Home safety checklists are available online that can help 
family members protect patients with dementia."
9591,"C. Behavioral
1."
9592,"Caregivers should be told to expect behavioral and 
personality changes and be instructed on how to respond."

9594,Maintenance of routines is important.
9595,3.
9596,"Situations likely to be stressful to patients, such as those 
in which a patient’s deficits interfere with his functioning, 
should be avoided."
9597,"D. Pharmacotherapy
1."
9598,"Cholinesterase inhibitors
a."
9599,"4 cholinesterase inhibitors are approved for treatment
(1) Donepezil
(2) Tacrine
(3) Rivastigmine
(4) Galantamine
b."
9600,"These medications have been shown to have modest effects 
on objective measures of dementia and functional status."
9601,2.
9602,"Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist also approved 
for the treatment of AD."
9603,"It has similar efficacy to the drugs 
above and may be used in combination with cholinesterase 
inhibitors."
9604,3.
9605,"Associated neuropsychiatric symptoms
a."
9606,"May include agitation (60–70%) or either delusions or 
hallucinations (30–60%)b. Atypical neuroleptics, such as olanzapine and 
risperidone, are frequently used but the evidence base 
for their efficacy is poor and they are associated with 
higher mortality."
9607,"Neither of these drugs is approved for 
this indication."
9608,4.
9609,"Depression
a."
9610,"Very common in patients with AD
b."
9611,"Present in up to 50% of patients
c. All patients with AD should be screened for depression 
and treated if it is found."
9612,5.
9613,"Caregiver support
a."
9614,Taking care of a friend or relative with AD is challenging.
9615,"b. Caregivers should be counseled on the importance of 
taking time off and the availability of respite care."
9616,"c. They should be counseled that behavioral difficulties 
are a result of the disease and not the patient’s anger or 
heartlessness."
9617,d. Caregiver support groups can be extremely helpful.
9618,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
Mr. R’s exam thus far reveals some difficulty with recalling recent 
events."
9619,"Given his age, his baseline risk of dementia is at least 10%."
9620,"The first step in his workup would be to perform a screening tests 
for dementia."
9621,"If this is positive, consider whether he fulfills the 
NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD."
9622,"2
Further history revealed that the patient’s wife had taken 
over bookkeeping because a few bills had gone unpaid during 
the last 3 months."
9623,The patient was given the Mini-Cog and scored 2 out of 5.
9624,"Consideration of the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria showed him 
to have dementia with deficits in 2 or more areas of cog -
nition (orientation, visuospatial and executive functioning, 
attention and working memory, and memory)."
9625,"At the time 
of the visit, it was not clear whether his cognitive func -
tioning was worsening, and there were no disturbances in 
consciousness."
9626,"The plan was made for initial laboratory work to be done 
and for a 3-month follow-up visit."
9627,"Given that he was taking 
multiple psychoactive medications, his regimen was scaled 
back to the minimum doses necessary to control his pain."
9628,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, AD?"
9629,"Have you ruled 
out the active alternatives?"

need to be done to exclude the alternative 
diagnoses?"
9631,"Alternative Diagnosis: Multi-infarct Dementia 
(Vascular Dementia, VaD)

and personality changes."
9644,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
9645,"The DSM -5 criteria for the clinical diagnosis of VaD are:
1."
9646,"The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive 
disorder."
9647,2.
9648,"The clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, 
as suggested by either of the following:
a. Onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to 
one or more cerebrovascular events."
9649,b.
9650,"Evidence for decline is prominent in complex attention 
(including processing speed) and frontal-executive 
function."
9651,3.
9652,"There is evidence of the presence of cerebrovascular 
disease from history, physical exam, and/or neuroimaging 
considered sufficient to account for the neurocognitive 
deficits."
9653,4.
9654,"The symptoms are not better explained by another brain 
disease or systemic disorder."
9655,B.
9656,"Features consistent with the diagnosis of VaD are:
1."
9657,"Exaggeration of deep tendon reflexes
2."
9658,"Extensor plantar response
3."
9659,"Gait abnormalities (consider history of unsteadiness and 
frequent, unprovoked falls)
4."

AD or VaD from a mixed dementia."
9669,"Treatment
A. Behavioral, pharmacologic, and surgical means of modifying risk 
factors for cerebrovascular disease and preventing recurrent 
vascular events should be used."
9670,"B. Behavioral interventions include smoking cessation and 
dietary intervention to decrease vascular risk."

T extbook Presentation
DLB is typically seen in a patient with Parkinson disease who has 
dementia."
9717,"The predominant symptoms of dementia are a fluctuat -
ing course and the presence of hallucinations."
9718,"In patients without 
a previous diagnosis of Parkinson disease, motor symptoms similar 
to those seen in Parkinson disease are often present."
9719,"Disease Highlights
A. DLB is among the most common types of dementia after AD."
9720,1.
9721,"Lewy bodies are seen in the cortex of about 20% of patients 
with dementia."
9722,2.
9723,"Lewy bodies may be present in some patients with a clinical 
diagnosis of AD thus DLB may coexist with AD."
9724,B.
9725,"The most important features of DLB are included in the 
Evidence-Based Diagnosis section below."
9726,C. Patients with DLB may have a fluctuating course.
9727,1.
9728,"Early in the disease, patients may be nearly normal at times 
and significantly impaired at others."
9729,2.
9730,"Because of the fluctuation in symptoms, delirium needs to 
be included in the differential diagnosis."
9731,"D. Visual hallucinations are common in DLB, unlike in most 
other types of dementia."
9732,"E. Mild extrapyramidal motor symptoms (rigidity and bradyki -
nesis) are often seen."
9733,"These may occur late in the course of 
other dementias but occur early with DLB.Evidence-Based Diagnosis
The diagnostic criteria for DLB are presented below."
9734,A.
9735,There is dementia (often mild at onset).
9736,B.
9737,"2 of the following are essential for a diagnosis of probable DLB:
1."
9738,"Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in 
attention and alertness
2."
9739,"Recurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well-formed 
and detailed
3."
9740,"Spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism
C. The following features are supportive of the diagnosis of DLB:
1."
9741,"Repeated falls
2."
9742,"Syncope
3."
9743,"T ransient loss of consciousness
4."
9744,"Neuroleptic sensitivity
5."
9745,"Systematized delusions and hallucinations
Treatment
A."
9746,"Supportive treatment of patients with DLB is the same as for 
patients with AD."
9747,B. Cholinesterase inhibitors have also been shown to be effective.
9748,"C. Neuroleptics can be dangerous, potentially worsening symptoms."
9749,"Patients with dementia with parkinsonian 
features, a fluctuating course, and visual hallu -
cinations should be evaluated for DLB before 
they are treated with neuroleptics."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mrs. D is a 50-year-old African American woman who is 
worried she has diabetes."
9859,What is the differential diagnosis of diabetes?
9860,How would you frame the differential?
9861,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) is actually 
a classification of the different types of diabetes:
A."
9862,"Type 1 DM
1."
9863,"Of the persons with DM in Canada, the United States, and 
Europe, 5–10% have type 1."
9864,2.
9865,"Caused by cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction 
of the pancreatic beta cells in genetically susceptible 
individuals, triggered by an undefined environmental 
agent
a."
9866,"Some combination of antibodies against islet cells, 
insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), or 
tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2beta are found 
in 85–90% of patients."
9867,b.
9868,"Strong HLA association
c. Risk is 0.4% in patients without family history, 5–6% 
in siblings and children, and 30% in monozygotic 
twins."
9869,"d. Patients are also prone to autoimmune thyroid disease, 
Addison disease, vitiligo, celiac disease, autoimmune 
hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia."
9870,3.
9871,Insulin therapy is always necessary.
9872,4.
9873,"Because of the complete lack of insulin production,  
patients are at high risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)."
9874,B.
9875,"Type 2 DM
1."
9876,"Caused by a progressive loss of beta cell insulin secretion 
frequently with underlying insulin resistance
2."
9877,"A heterogeneous disorder related to inflammation, metabolic 
stress, and genetic factors
C. Other, less common causes of diabetes
1."
9878,"Monogenic diabetes syndromes
2."
9879,"Exocrine pancreatic diseases that lead to the destruction 
of beta cells (pancreatitis, trauma, cystic fibrosis, 
pancreatectomy, pancreatic carcinoma)3."
9880,"Endocrinopathies (acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, 
glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma)
4."
9881,"Drug or chemical-induced (corticosteroids, HIV/AIDS 
medications, after organ transplantation)
D. Gestational diabetes
Type 1 DM generally occurs in children, although approxi -
mately 7.5–10% of adults assumed to have type 2 DM actually 
have type 1, as defined by the presence of circulating antibodies."
9882,"Type 2 DM is becoming more prevalent in teenagers and young 
adults, presumably related to the increased prevalence of obesity."
9883,"In most patients, the distinction between type 1 and type 2 DM 
is clear."
9884,"Thus, the primary tasks of the clinician are to determine 
who should be tested for diabetes, who has diabetes, which compli -
cations to monitor, and how to treat the patient."
9885,"1
Mrs. D has worried about having diabetes since her father 
died of complications from the disease."
9886,"Over the last couple 
of weeks, she has been urinating more often and notes larger 
volumes than usual."
9887,"She is aware that excess urination can 
be a symptom of diabetes, so she scheduled an appointment."
9888,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
9889,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
9890,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mrs. D’s pretest probability of diabetes is high because of 2 pivotal 
points in her history, the polyuria and the positive family history."
9891,"Excess fluid intake and diseases that cause true polyuria, defined 
as urinary output of > 3 L/day, should also be considered."
9892,"Bladder 
dysfunction and urinary tract infection generally cause frequent, 
small volume urination."
9893,"Since patients sometimes have trouble 
quantifying the amount of urine produced, causes of small volume 
urinary frequency should be kept in the differential."
9894,"Table 12-1 
lists the differential diagnosis."
9895,"1
Mrs. D has no dysuria or hematuria."
9896,"She takes no medica -
tions, drinks 1 cup of coffee per day, and uses alcohol rarely."
9897,"She has been trying to lose weight and has been drinking 
more water in an attempt to reduce her appetite."
9898,"(continued)I have a patient who is concerned that she has 
diabetes."
9899,"How do I confirm the diagnosis and treat 
patients with diabetes?"

(FPG), HbA1c, or both; the oral glucose tolerance test is used 
primarily to screen for gestational diabetes."

disadvantage is the need for fasting at least 8 hours."
9966,2.
9967,"The HbA1c is now globally standardized and does not 
require fasting."
9968,"a. Falsely low values can occur in patients with rapid red 
cell turnover, such as in hemoglobinopathies, active 
hemolysis, erythropoietin treatment, and stage 4 or 5 
chronic kidney disease."
9969,"b. Falsely high values can be seen when red cell turnover is 
low, such as in iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency."
9970,"c. African American patients tend to have slightly higher 
HbA1c levels (0.2–0.4%) than white patients at the same 
glucose levels."
9971,"D. Patients may have abnormal results on 1 or both tests; in 
1 study, one-third of new diabetes cases were detected by FPG 
testing only, one-third by HbA1c testing only, and one-third by 
both tests."

exercise program maintained a 34% relative risk 
reduction in the development of diabetes over 10 years."
9988,3.
9989,"Acarbose, orlistat, liraglutide, and pioglitazone have also 
been studied, but the ADA does not recommend their use 
in diabetes prevention."
9990,"Lifestyle modification is the best way to 
prevent or delay the onset of diabetes."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. C is a 35-year-old man who comes to your outpatient 
office complaining of 3 days of diarrhea."
10691,What is the differential diagnosis of diarrhea?
10692,How would you frame the differential?
10693,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
A first step in assessing diarrhea is to categorize the frequency 
and duration of bowel movements."
10694,"Diarrhea is defined as at least 
3 loose bowel movements per day."
10695,"Often patients and clinicians 
will mislabel loose bowel movements as diarrhea solely because the 
stool is loose."
10696,"If a patient does fit the clinical criteria for diarrhea, 
the diarrhea can be further characterized as acute, persistent, or 
chronic."
10697,"Acute diarrhea has a duration of less than 14 days, per -
sistent diarrhea 14–29 days, and chronic diarrhea at least 30 days."
10698,"The differential diagnosis varies significantly based on the duration 
of symptoms."
10699,"This chapter focuses specifically on diagnosis and 
treatment of acute diarrhea."
10700,"Acute diarrhea can be further subcategorized into infectious 
and noninfectious causes, with infectious causes accounting for the 
majority of cases of acute, self-limited diarrheal illnesses."
10701,"Several factors are important in reasoning through a case of 
acute diarrhea including (1) associated signs and symptoms, 
(2) duration of symptoms, (3) exposure history, (4) history of 
immunosuppressive conditions, and (5) epidemiology of specific 
infectious pathogens."
10702,"A detailed history of symptoms and exposures helps guide the 
evaluation and treatment of acute diarrhea."
10703,"Noninfectious diarrhea 
is typically characterized by lack of constitutional symptoms and 
presence of a culprit medication, supplement, food, or other con -
dition (eg, pancreatic insufficiency)."
10704,"Therefore, taking a thorough 
history of medications, supplements, diet, and underlying medical 
conditions is essential to prioritize an initial differential diagnosis 
for acute diarrhea."
10705,"Infectious diarrhea can be associated with symptoms such as 
fever, myalgias, severe abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and 
stool with blood or mucus."
10706,"However, lack of any of these symptoms 
does not rule out a diagnosis of infectious diarrhea."
10707,"Symptoms of 
infectious diarrhea may also suggest whether the diarrhea origi -
nates in the large or small bowel, which can narrow the likelihood 
of specific pathogens."
10708,"Patients with large volume, watery bowel 
movements, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, bloating, and 
gas are more likely to have gastroenteritis and the pathogens most 
commonly associated with this condition."
10709,Mucus or blood in the stool is rarely present in gastroenteritis.
10710,"In contrast, patients with 
tenesmus and passage of many small-volume stools with blood 
and/or mucus are more likely to have colitis and the pathogens 
more commonly associated with this condition."

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
10739,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Naming the problem in the most descriptive possible way, taking 
into account the pivotal points in the presentation, is an important 
first step in prioritizing a differential diagnosis."
10740,"In this case, the prob -
lem could be called acute-onset, watery diarrhea , or even acute-onset 
gastroenteritis ."
10741,"Correspondingly, the differential diagnosis should 
focus on causes of acute diarrhea and gastroenteritis."
10742,"The presence of 
constitutional symptoms and the lack of concurrent medical condi -
tions, offending foods, supplements, and medications make causes of 
noninfectious diarrhea much less likely."
10743,"When prioritizing a differen -
tial diagnosis, assessing the epidemiology, or frequency of diagnoses 
in the population of interest, is helpful."
10744,"In cases of acute diarrhea, 
at least 87% result from infectious causes."
10745,"Therefore, based on the 
epidemiology of acute diarrhea, an infectious etiology is more likely."
10746,"The presence of nausea and vomiting and lack of colitis-associated 
symptoms of mucous, blood, and tenesmus makes pathogens that 
cause gastroenteritis more probable."
10747,"To prioritize the differential diagnosis, a thorough travel, expo -
sure, medical, and sexual history is essential."
10748,"International travel is 
especially important given the regional differences in epidemiology 
of infectious pathogens."
10749,"Exposure history should include detailed 
dietary history, water exposures through drinking or swimming, 
healthcare exposure, antibiotic exposure, contact with animals, 
known sick contacts, and exposure to childcare settings."
10750,"Table 13-1 
lists specific exposures and corresponding pathogens."
10751,"Past medical 
history should focus on known history of immunocompromising 
conditions, medications, or history of past infections that would 
raise suspicion of an immunocompromising condition such as 
HIV."

10802,"For patients with mild diarrhea and little volume 
depletion, oral fluids (eg, sports drinks, pediatric 
electrolyte drinks, and soup broth) are appropriate

oral rehydration solution has the following composition:
(1) Sodium: 75 mmol/L
(2) Chloride: 65 mmol/L
(3) Glucose: 75 mmol/L
(4) Potassium: 20 mmol/L
(5) Citrate: 10 mmol/L
d. If this solution is not available, patients can be 
instructed to mix the following in 1 L of water
(1) One-half teaspoon of salt
(2) One-quarter teaspoon of baking soda
(3) 8 teaspoons of sugar

10825,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
1
At the time of the patient’s initial visit he was beginning 
to feel better."
10826,"He still noted an “upset stomach” and was 
having watery diarrhea every 2–3 hours."
10827,"He had not had 
any vomiting in about 6 hours and was able to tolerate 
fluids."
10828,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, norovirus?"
10829,"Have 
you ruled out the active alternatives?"
10830,"Do 
other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"
10831,"In this case, given the classic symptoms, childcare exposure, and 
epidemiologic likelihood of norovirus as a cause of community- 
acquired gastroenteritis, it is the most likely diagnosis."
10832,"The clini -
cal history, lack of suspicious exposures, and the lower frequency 
of other causes in community-acquired gastroenteritis (see 
Table 13-3) make other causes less likely."
10833,"Although toxin-mediated 
gastroenteritis is a consideration, there is no commercially available diagnostic testing, and treatment is supportive."
10834,"There are sporadic 
cases of other causes of infectious diarrhea such as Salmonella , but 
almost all of these infections resolve spontaneously."
10835,"No diagnostic 
testing is warranted in this case due to lack of severe symptoms or 
risk factors for complication."
10836,"In fact, only 2–15% of tests for bac -
terial pathogens are positive and only 0.4–0.7% of tests for ova and 
parasites are positive in resource-rich settings."
10837,"Patients and settings 
that indicate need for evaluation include the following:
A."
10838,"Patients with bloody diarrhea
B. Outbreak is suspected
C. Patients at high risk for infecting others, including:
1."
10839,"Residents of long-term–care facilities
2."
10840,"Daycare workers
3."
10841,"Food service workers
4."
10842,"Healthcare workers
D. Patients with severe disease (dehydration, toxic appearance, 
high fever) or risk factors for poor outcome (immunosuppres -
sion, severe comorbid illnesses)."
10843,"E. Patients with prolonged diarrhea (>7 days)
Must not miss diagnoses include those that would indicate 
a more significant predisposing immunosuppressive condition 
that could progress if not diagnosed (eg, HIV)."
10844,"Other must not 
miss diagnoses are infections that would present a public health 
concern in people who have the potential to easily spread them 
such as healthcare workers, childcare workers, and food han -
dlers."
10845,"Finally, other must not  miss diagnoses include those that 
could progress rapidly to life-threatening infections, including 
C difficile, Vibrio  species, and enteric fever caused by Salmonella 
typhi and Salmonella paratyphi."
10846,"However, in almost all cases, these 
diagnoses can be ruled out by a careful history, and additional 
testing is not warranted unless associated characteristics and risks 
are identified."
10847,"In this case, no compelling reason for diagnostic testing or 
treatment is present."
10848,"In most patients with an acute diarrheal illness, 
diagnostic testing is not helpful to the patient 
but may be important from a public health 
standpoint."

Mr. C was sent home with directions for oral rehydration."
10921,"He reported sleeping for most of the afternoon and was 
well enough to return to work the next day."
10922,"By the following 
day (day 4 of the presentation), the patient was com -

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
10937,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Key elements in the patient’s current presentation include the 
10-day duration of the symptoms, lack of constitutional symptoms, 
recent gastrointestinal illness, and recent exposure to antibiotics."
10938,"These key features suggest that both infectious and noninfectious 
causes should be considered."
10939,"Both the duration of symptoms and 
the recent gastroenteritis should raise the possibility of lactose 
intolerance."
10940,"Lactose intolerance is common after gastroenteritis 
due to injury to the small bowel mucosa."
10941,"Other potential diagno -
ses include recurrent gastroenteritis, side effect of the antibiotic, 
and C difficile  infection."
10942,"Recurrent infectious gastroenteritis can 
occur since many of the bacteria that cause diarrhea can persist 
in the stool after clinical symptoms have resolved."
10943,"This feature is 
especially common with Salmonella  and Campylobacter."
10944,"Antibiotics 
also have been associated with a paradoxical prolonged carriage rate 
especially in non-typhoidal Salmonella  infections, possibly due to 
their effect on the intestinal microbiome."
10945,"Diarrhea is also a common side effect of antibiotics and compli -
cates as much as 25% of antibiotic courses."
10946,"Given the recent anti -
biotic exposure, C difficile  infection should also be considered."
10947,"The 
prolonged nature of the illness should prompt consideration of the 
less typical pathogens, such as parasites, but if testing is considered 
necessary, it should focus on pathogens that may be endemic to 
the specific regions of exposure."
10948,"Table 13-5 reviews the differential 
diagnosis for this presentation."
10949,"A targeted history focused on asso -
ciation with milk and milk-containing foods or new medications as 
well as any new exposures or symptoms will help further prioritize 
the differential diagnosis."

day just to pass gas."
10953,"The patient took 3 doses of amoxicillin on the day he 
first came to see you."
10954,He ran out after these 3 doses.
10955,"The

10958,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"
10959,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
10960,"Leading Hypothesis: Lactose Intolerance
T extbook Presentation
Lactose intolerance commonly presents with symptoms of belch -
ing, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea."
10961,"Though usually chronic, 
the symptoms may be acute or subacute in the setting of recent 
infection or dietary changes."
10962,"Symptoms are associated with intake 
of milk or milk-containing products."
10963,"Disease Highlights
A. Lactase is the enzyme that metabolizes lactose."
10964,1.
10965,"Rarely, it can be deficient at birth."
10966,2.
10967,"More commonly, it can become deficient with age."
10968,B.
10969,"It is thought that some ethnicities evolved persistent lactase 
activity because of the importance of milk products as a 
calorie source in their environments."
10970,"C. Lactose intolerance can be caused by lactase deficiency or 
lactose malabsorption."
10971,1.
10972,"Acquired lactase deficiency is most common in people of 
Asian, African, Middle East, Mediterranean, and Native 
American ancestry."
10973,2.
10974,"Secondary lactose malabsorption can occur in the setting 
of underlying bowel diseases, small intestinal bacterial 
overgrowth, and infection of the small bowel."
10975,"This process 
is more common in people with low levels of lactase 
activity at baseline."
10976,"Lactose intolerance after episodes of gastroen -
teritis has been reported as high as 50-70% but 
frequency depends on patient ethnicity."
10977,"D. Milk, ice cream, and yogurt have the highest levels of lactose."
10978,"E. Foods with high lactose and low fat (skim milk) tend to cause 
the most symptoms as these foods deliver lactose to the small 
intestine the fastest."
10979,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
10980,"The diagnosis of lactose intolerance is made clinically based 
on a consistent history and resolution of symptoms on a 
lactose-free diet.B."
10981,"More definitive tests, including lactose tolerance test or lactose 
breath hydrogen test, can be performed in patients in whom 
the diagnosis is likely but not clear historically."
10982,1.
10983,"False-negative testing can occur in setting of recent 
antibiotic use."
10984,2.
10985,"False-positive testing can occur in the setting of small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth."
10986,"Treatment
A. Lactose intolerance is treated by decreasing lactose intake."
10987,B.
10988,"Enzyme supplementation with lactase is often helpful in 
patients with chronic symptoms."
10989,"C. In post-gastroenteritis lactose malabsorption, lactase activity 
will eventually recover when the intestinal brush border 
regenerates."
10990,"D. Because of the high prevalence of mild lactose intolerance and 
the frequent exacerbation following gastroenteritis, patients 
with acute gastroenteritis should be advised to avoid dairy 
products for 2 weeks after recovery."

abdominal exam reveals hyperactive bowel sounds with 
minimal distention."

the leading hypothesis, lactose intolerance?"
10997,Have you ruled out the active alternatives?
10998,"Do other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"
10999,"Lactose intolerance is most likely, given the high incidence of this 
condition in patients following episodes of gastroenteritis as well 
as the history of association with reintroduction of dairy products."
11000,"The patient is less likely to have an infectious cause of diarrhea 
due to lack of constitutional signs and symptoms."
11001,"Although anti -
biotic side effect should be considered, diarrhea from this cause 
typically resolves soon after cessation of the antibiotic."
11002,"Another 
consideration in a patient who has had a recent antibiotic exposure 
is C difficile  infection."
11003,"Given the duration of symptoms of greater 
than 7 days, diarrhea caused by a parasitic infection becomes more 
of a consideration, but is still unlikely given the low prevalence in 
the United States."

Disease Highlights
A."
11026,"C difficile  accounts for 10–20% of diarrhea in the setting of 
recent antibiotic exposure."
11027,B.
11028,"C difficile  causes diarrhea via toxin-mediated effects on the 
large bowel, which can present with severe diarrhea, often with 
abdominal pain and leukocytosis."
11029,"C. Risk factors for C difficile  include advanced age, hospitaliza -
tion, antibiotic use, and proton pump inhibitor use."
11030,1.
11031,"Although C difficile  is classically associated with healthcare 
exposure, the incidence of community-associated C difficile  
is rising, with up to 41% of all cases of C difficile  being 
community-associated in some areas."
11032,2.
11033,"C difficile  should also be suspected in hospitalized patients 
with unexplained leucocytosis."
11034,3.
11035,C difficile  has been associated with almost every antibiotic.
11036,"Those associated with the highest risk of C difficile  include 
clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-
generation cephalosporins."
11037,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
1."
11038,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the diagnostic 
standard with sensitivity ≥ 90% and specificity ≥ 97%."
11039,"PCR can be performed alone or using an algorithm that

PATIENT 2
Mr. V is a 35-year-old man who is admitted to your acute-
care hospital after presenting with 4 days of diarrhea."
11086,He reports feeling tired and weak.
11087,"He is having 6–8 bowel 
movements a day."
11088,"He says that he has significant abdom -
inal pain."
11089,"On the day of admission, he began to pass bloody 
stools."
11090,"On physical exam, his vital signs are temperature, 
38.3°C; BP , 130/84 mm Hg; pulse, 90 bpm; RR, 12 breaths 
per minute."
11091,He is orthostatic.
11092,"His abdomen has hyperac -

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
11096,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
11097,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The pivotal points in this case are the presence of bloody diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, and fever."
11098,"Bacterial pathogens are much more 
likely than other pathogens to cause bloody diarrhea."
11099,"The bacteria 
that commonly cause bloody diarrhea are Shigella  species, Campy -
lobacter  species, and E coli."
11100,"Salmonella  species, Y enterocolitica,  and 
C difficile  also may cause bloody diarrhea."
11101,"Noninfectious causes, 
such as ischemia or an initial presentation of inflammatory bowel 
disease, should also be considered."
11102,"Clinically, it is impossible to differentiate, with certainty, 
between the different causes of bacterial diarrhea, but a careful his -
tory focused on potential exposures and risk factors as well as the 
knowledge of the epidemiology of the relevant infections can help 
prioritize the differential diagnosis."
11103,"Table 13-6 lists the differential 
diagnosis."
11104,"2
The patient’s diarrhea began 4 days prior to admission."
11105,"The diarrhea was watery and was accompanied by abdom -

Leading Hypothesis: Shigella  Infection
T extbook Presentation
Shigella  infection often presents with fever and constitutional 
symptoms."
11116,Diarrhea is initially watery and may become bloody.
11117,The diarrhea can be frequent.
11118,Tenesmus is often present.
11119,"Disease Highlights
A. Shigella  has been reported to be the most common cause of 
bloody diarrhea in the United States."
11120,B.
11121,"There have been outbreaks of Shigella  in people who engage in 
anal-genital or anal-oral sexual intercourse."
11122,"C. Although there is a spectrum of disease, a patient who is 
systemically ill with classic dysentery (frequent bloody stools 
with tenesmus) is most likely to have Shigella  infection."
11123,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
11124,"Similar to the case with Salmonella  (discussed earlier) both 
PCR testing (as part of multipathogen molecular panels) or 
stool culture can be used to diagnose Shigella ."
11125,"B. PCR testing is associated with high sensitivity (93–97%) and 
specificity (98–100%) for detecting Shigella  species."
11126,C. Stool culture allows for susceptibility testing.
11127,"Because of 
increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, particularly in men 
who have sex with men, culture should be performed in 
addition to molecular testing."
11128,"D. Understanding local laboratory protocols is important to 
determine what tests are performed when a stool culture is 
ordered."
11129,"Treatment
A. Shigella  dysentery benefits from treatment, by shortening the 
duration of symptoms and decreasing bacterial shedding."
11130,"B. Ciprofloxacin is a reasonable empiric treatment option, but 
selection of an antibiotic should be based on susceptibility 
testing as well as knowledge of local resistance patterns in 
target populations as a result of increasing antibiotic resistance."
11131,"Alternative Hypothesis: Campylobacter  Infection
T extbook Presentation
Presenting symptoms of Campylobacter  infection are usually 
diarrhea and abdominal pain."
11132,"The diarrhea is often profuse and 
watery and preceded by fever."
11133,"The fever usually resolves over the 
first 2 days of the illness, while the diarrhea and abdominal pain 
may last 4–6 days."
11134,"Disease Highlights
A. Campylobacter  species are among the most commonly isolated 
bacterial pathogens in patients with diarrhea and the second 
most common causes of bloody diarrhea behind Shigella  
species."
11135,"B. Campylobacter  species can be carried by domestic animals such 
as birds and farm animals (eg, pigs), and they can be found in 
undercooked meat and poultry."
11136,"C. Campylobacter  rarely can be transmitted from person-to-person, 
including through genital-anal, oral-anal, and digital-anal 
contact."
11137,"D. Common aspects of the presentation are
1."
11138,"Constitutional symptoms, including fever, occur before 
gastrointestinal symptoms.2."
11139,"Bloody diarrhea may occur after 2–3 days of watery 
diarrhea in a small percentage of patients."
11140,3.
11141,"Diarrhea is often associated with abdominal pain and can 
be severe, sometimes mimicking appendicitis."
11142,"E. Campylobacter  infection can rarely be associated with 
extraintestinal complications, such as reactive arthritis and 
Guillain-Barré syndrome."
11143,"F. Bacteria commonly remain in the stool for 4–5 weeks and 
reinfection can occur."
11144,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Stool cultures with selective media for Campylobacter  can 
make the diagnosis, but sensitivity is lower compared to other 
bacterial pathogens (37-70%)."
11145,"B. PCR testing is increasing in clinical settings and has much 
higher sensitivity (93-97%) for Campylobacter  than culture; 
however, PCR testing does not provide susceptibility data, 
which can be performed only on positive cultures."
11146,"Organisms that are generally associated with 
dysentery ( Shigella, Campylobacter,  Shiga 
toxin-producing E coli ) are at least as likely to 
cause non-bloody diarrhea and a gastroenteritis-
type illness, so the absence of bloody diarrhea 
does not rule out these diagnoses."
11147,"Treatment
A."
11148,"Most cases of Campylobacter  infection do not require 
antibiotics and are self-limited."
11149,B.
11150,"Patients with severe symptoms (see Figure 13-1) should be 
treated with antibiotics."
11151,"C. Fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotics can be used as 
empiric therapy, but resistance is increasing so choice should 
be based on local susceptibility patterns and results of 
antibiotic susceptibility testing."
11152,"Antidiarrheals should never be used for 
patients with dysentery or signs of invasive 
infection (tenesmus, blood or mucus in stool, 
high fever, and severe abdominal pain)."
11153,"Alternative Diagnosis: Shiga  toxin–producing 
E coli  (STEC)
T extbook Presentation
STEC usually presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain."
11154,"The 
pain is often worse in the right lower quadrant."

very common, while nausea, vomiting, and fever are not."
11156,"Disease Highlights
A. Nomenclature
1."
11157,STEC is a strain of E coli  that produces Shiga  toxin.
11158,2.
11159,STEC is also called enterohemorrhagic E coli  (EHEC).
11160,3.
11161,"The most common strain of STEC in the United States is 
O157:H7."
11162,4.
11163,"Other than STEC, there are 4 types of E coli  that cause 
diarrheal illness in adults."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. J is a 32-year-old man who comes to your office com -
plaining of dizziness."
11382,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
dizziness?"
11383,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
11384,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Dizziness may arise from diseases of the inner ear; central and 
peripheral nervous system; cardiovascular system; and occasionally, 
psychiatric conditions."
11385,"This leads to an extensive differential diag -
nosis."
11386,"Fortunately, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed with 
an organized approach."
11387,"The first pivotal step is to recognize that 
most patients who complain of dizziness are actually complaining 
of 1 of 3 distinct symptoms: vertigo, near syncope, or dysequilib -
rium."
11388,"(Patients who are unable to clearly describe their dizziness, 
are referred to as having ill-defined light-headedness.)"
11389,"Identifying 
the more specific symptom narrows the differential diagnosis and 
focuses the evaluation."
11390,"Therefore, the first step asks the patient 
“What does it feel like when you are dizzy?” (Figure 14-1)."
11391,"Patients must then be given enough time, without interruptions 
or suggestions,  to describe their dizziness as clearly as possible."
11392,"Additionally, the event that triggers the symptom can also help 
classify the symptom as vertigo, near syncope, or dysequilibrium."
11393,"For instance, dizziness that occurs when rolling over in bed or 
with head movement suggests vertigo, upon standing suggests 
near syncope, or when walking suggests dysequilibrium."
11394,"It is also 
important to determine whether the symptom is constant or inter -
mittent and to ask about other associated symptoms that may be 
important diagnostic clues (ie, other neurologic or cardiac symp -
toms)."
11395,"Table  14-1 summarizes chief complaints, triggers, other 
historical features, and differential diagnoses."
11396,"After identifying the more precise symptom that the patient is 
experiencing, the second pivotal step addresses these more specific 
symptoms in detail."
11397,"Vertigo
Vertigo is a sense of spinning or motion and is the most com -
mon type of dizziness."
11398,"The differential diagnosis of vertigo is 
extensive and includes diseases of the peripheral nervous system 
(inner ear) and CNS (brainstem)."
11399,"The most important task in 
the evaluation of patients with vertigo is to identify patients with 
“must not miss” life-threatening central causes, including stroke, 
hemorrhage, tumors, and multiple sclerosis (MS)."
11400,"Therefore, the first pivotal step  in the evaluation of patients with vertigo is to 
look for clues on history and neurologic exam that suggest CNS 
disease (Figure 14-2)."
11401,"Since the vestibular system resides in the 
brainstem, central vertigo is often accompanied by other brain -
stem or cerebellar findings, which is where the history and exam 
should focus."
11402,"Patients should be asked about CNS symptoms of 
new severe headache or neck pain, symptoms of brainstem dys -
function (dysarthria, diplopia, facial weakness), symptoms of 
cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia or incoordination) and examined 
for brainstem or cerebellar signs (dysconjugate gaze, facial weak -
ness, other cranial nerve abnormalities, abnormal gait, abnormal 
Romberg, dysmetria, or papilledema)."
11403,"The CNS exam should also 
carefully look for nystagmus."
11404,"While many patients have physio -
logic endpoint nystagmus (a few beats of nystagmus on far lateral 
gaze), some types of nystagmus suggest a central etiology."
11405,"These 
include the following:
1."
11406,"Bidirectional nystagmus refers to nystagmus that occurs both 
when the patient looks to the left and to the right."
11407,"(The fast 
component goes to the left when the patient is looking left and 
to the right when the patient is looking right.)"
11408,2.
11409,Nystagmus that is not inhibited by visual fixation on an object.
11410,3.
11411,"Nystagmus that lasts > 1 minute or fails to fatigue with 
repetition."
11412,"Table 14-2 contrasts the features distinguishing central from 
peripheral vertigo."
11413,"Any patient with unexplained CNS symptom(s) 
or sign(s) should have prompt evaluation of the brainstem, prefer -
ably with MRI."
11414,"The second pivotal step  in vertiginous patients without obvi -
ous CNS symptoms or signs, reviews the time course of the vertigo 
as well as its trigger to determine the appropriate evaluation and 
differential diagnosis (Figure 14-3)."
11415,"This is critical because surprisingly some patients with central 
vertigo do not have obvious CNS symptoms and signs and may 
not be identified by that first pivotal step."
11416,"A systematic evaluation 
can nonetheless identify these patients."
11417,"In particular, the precise 
duration of each episode of vertigo  must be determined because this 
dramatically narrows the differential diagnosis."
11418,"Although patients 
may say that their vertigo started days ago, the follow-up question 
must ascertain how long each individual episode  lasts."
11419,"Another key 
question is whether the vertigo is actually triggered by head move -
ment or simply made worse by head movement ."
11420,"Almost all causes of 
vertigo are made worse by head movement but only some are actu -
ally precipitated/triggered by head movement."
11421,"These two questions 
(episode duration and trigger) identify 3 distinct groups of patients 
with vertigo (Figure 14-3)."
11422,"The most common group are patients with episodes of vertigo 
that are very brief (typically < 1 minute) that are triggered by head 
motion ( and absent while still )."
11423,"Virtually all such patients have 
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that can be evaluated 
with the Dix Hallpike maneuver (discussed below).I have a patient with dizziness."
11424,"How do I 
determine the cause?"

11435,"The second group has recurrent  episodes of vertigo that lasts 
for minutes to hours."
11436,"The vertigo for these patients is typically 
made worse by motion but is spontaneous and present even with -
out motion."
11437,"The differential diagnosis for such patients includes 
TIA, vestibular migraine, or Meniere disease."
11438,"Useful clues in such 
patients include cardiovascular disease risk factors (suggesting 
TIA), a headache history (suggesting vestibular migraine), or a 
history of other auditory symptoms such as tinnitus or hearing loss 
(suggesting Meniere disease) (Figure 14-4)."
11439,"The third group of patients has vertigo that is continuous for 
days and made worse by motion."
11440,"This syndrome is referred to as 
the acute vestibular syndrome and may be caused by vestibular 
neuritis, stroke, or other CNS causes."
11441,"A detailed approach to 
such patients is critical to detect small brainstem strokes that may 
initially be subtle and yet lead to life-threatening complications."
11442,"The approach to the acute vestibular syndrome is discussed in 
detail below and illustrated in Figure 14-5.As mentioned above, many patients have other, nonvertiginous 
causes of dizziness, including near syncope and dysequilibrium."
11443,"Near Syncope
The differential diagnosis and approach to near syncope is covered 
in detail in Chapter 31."
11444,"Dysequilibrium
Dysequilibrium is the sensation of falling or imbalance associated 
with difficulty walking or standing and can arise from abnormal -
ities of the brain, cerebellum, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves."
11445,"Common causes include Parkinson disease, normal-pressure 
hydrocephalus, cerebellar degeneration (eg, alcoholic cerebellar 
degeneration), cerebellar stroke, vertebrobasilar insufficiency 
(VBI), vitamin B12 deficiency, tabes dorsalis, diabetes mellitus, and 
multiple sensory deficits."
11446,"The cranial nerve, cerebellar, gait, and 
sensory exams may provide critical clues that help focus the diag -
nosis."
11447,"Gait disturbances may suggest Parkinson disease (shuffling 
gait) or cerebellar disease (wide-based gait)."
11448,"Stocking glove sensory 
deficits are typical of diabetic neuropathy, whereas loss of propri -
oception suggests posterior column disease (ie, vitamin B12 defi-
ciency, tabes dorsalis, and some compressive spinal lesions)."
11449,"A 
diagnostic approach is illustrated in Figure 14-6."
11450,"Ill-defined Light-headedness
In practice, many patients have difficulty describing their symp -
tom and are referred to as having ill-defined light-headedness 
(Figure 14-1)."
11451,"Such patients may suffer from any of the aforemen -
tioned disorders but cannot describe the symptom in a manner that 
allows it to be recognized."
11452,"Others have nonspecific dizziness that 
may be caused by depression, anxiety, or a medication."
11453,"Patients 
with ill-defined light-headedness should be asked about neurologic 
and cardiac symptoms and signs that may point to the involved 
system."
11454,"For instance, dizzy patients with other CNS symptoms 
or signs (new headache, double vision, ataxia, or diplopia) almost 
certainly have CNS disease, whereas patients who note dizziness 
immediately on standing associated with a drop in their BP almost

Clearly, Mr. J is describing vertigo, the most common complaint 
in patients with dizziness."
11493,See Figure 14-1.
11494,"Patients with vertigo 
complain that either they or their surroundings are spinning."
11495,"Recognizing that Mr. J is suffering from vertigo allows the exam -
iner to limit the differential diagnosis to the subset of diseases that 
cause vertigo (Table 14-1)."
11496,"As noted above, the first pivotal step  in the evaluation of 
patients with vertigo is to look for signs or symptoms that suggest 
central vertigo."
11497,"Since these are must not miss diagnoses, a careful 
neurologic history and exam searching for cranial nerve or cerebel -
lar findings is crucial (Figure 14-2).1
On further questioning, Mr. J reports that he had a similar 
episode 5 years ago."
11498,"Other than nausea, he has no other 
symptoms."
11499,"Specifically, he has not had definitive CNS 
symptoms such as new severe headache or neck pain, diplo -
pia, numbness, weakness, dysarthria, or trouble walking."
11500,"On 
physical exam, he appears anxious."

11569,Spontaneous nystagmus is absent.
11570,"(In spontaneous 
nystagmus, change in gaze without a change in head position

As noted in the beginning of the chapter the first pivotal point 
in dizzy patients distinguishes vertigo from near syncope or dys -
equilibrium (see Figure 14-1)."
11611,"Clearly, Mr. D is suffering from 
vertigo."
11612,"The second step searches for CNS signs or symptoms 
that might suggest central vertigo (Figure 14-3)."

Mr. D denies any history of significant headaches."
11615,"He denies 
any history of prior or current neurologic complaints, such 
as diplopia, visual loss, ataxia, or unexplained motor or sen -
sory symptoms."
11616,He does note some intermittent nausea.
11617,"On physical exam his vital signs are BP , 126/82 mm Hg; 
pulse, 74 bpm; RR, 16 breaths per minute; temperature, 
37.0°C."
11618,"HEENT exam reveals that his pupils are equal, 
round, react to light and accommodation."
11619,"Extraocular 
movements are intact."
11620,"Neurologic exam reveals normal gait, 
motor strength, sensation, negative Romberg sign, and 
intact cranial nerves."
11621,"Mr. D has no obvious symptoms or signs to suggest central ver -
tigo."
11622,"As noted above, the next step in vertiginous patients without 
obvious CNS symptoms or signs is to review the time course of the 
vertigo as well as its trigger to determine the appropriate evaluation 
and differential diagnosis (see Figure 14-3).2
Mr. D repeats that his vertigo has been present for days."
11623,"He reports that head motion makes it worse, but that it is 
also present even while he is still."
11624,"He has never had any prior 
similar episodes."
11625,"Unlike our first patient Mr. J, Mr. D has vertigo that is con -
tinuous, lasting for days and spontaneous (that is present even 
without head motion)."
11626,"Patients with a single prolonged episode 
(days) of spontaneous vertigo (present without motion) are clas -
sified as having the acute vestibular syndrome."
11627,"Its differential 
diagnosis includes vestibular neuritis, stroke, and other CNS 
causes (ie, MS)."
11628,"Of these, vestibular neuritis is the most com -

patients with an intact vestibular ocular reflex, the patient is able 
to maintain eye contact with the examiner’s nose despite the head 
thrust."
11650,"In vestibular neuritis, the vestibular-ocular reflex is impaired, 
and the eyes move with patient’s head making them unable to 
maintain visual fixation on the examiner’s nose."
11651,"The patient’s eyes 
then saccade back to return the nose to focus."
11652,This is referred to as a positive head thrust test.
11653,"Thus, patients with vestibular neuritis 
usually have an abnormal head impulse test, which is paradoxi -
cally reassuring."
11654,"See https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-

On the other hand, the vestibular ocular reflex is often intact

11655,"Such 
patients are usually able to maintain focus on the examiner’s finger 
or nose when their head is turned and such patients usually have a 
normal (or negative) head impulse test."
11656,"The head impulse test should not be utilized to evaluate patients 
with brief episodes of vertigo, which are not suggestive of the acute 
vestibular syndrome because the results may be confusing."
11657,"In summary, a negative (normal) head thrust in a patient with 
the acute vestibular syndrome suggests a central lesion rather than 
vestibular neuritis."
11658,"Direction changing nystagmus  refers to nystagmus in which

Leading Hypothesis: Acute Vestibular Neuritis
T extbook Presentation
Acute vestibular neuritis typically presents abruptly with severe 
constant vertigo and nausea made worse by head turning that lasts 
for days."
11671,"The vertigo is often exacerbated by head motion (similar 
to BPPV) but present even at rest (unlike BPPV)."
11672,"Subsequently, 
patients may complain of intermittent vertigo that occurs for 
weeks to months and is precipitated by head movement."
11673,"Disease Highlights
A."
11674,"Acute vestibular neuritis is caused by inflammation of the 
vestibular-cochlear nerve."
11675,"This innervates the anterior and 
horizontal semicircular canals resulting in vertigo."
11676,B.
11677,"The inferior division supplies the cochlea and is usually 
asymptomatic, leaving hearing typically unimpaired."
11678,"C. The etiology is uncertain but may be due to reactivation of 
herpes simplex virus 1."
11679,"D. Severe vertigo typically lasts 2–3 days and may last up to 
1 week."
11680,Milder symptoms may persist for 6 weeks or longer.
11681,E. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a variant of vestibular neuritis.
11682,1.
11683,"Varicella zoster reactivation involving cranial nerves 
VII and VIII produces vestibular neuritis with hearing 
loss and facial weakness."
11684,2.
11685,Vesicles are seen in the external auditory canal.
11686,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
11687,"Diagnosis is usually made through clinical examination and 
consideration of other more serious alternative diagnoses."
11688,"(Cerebellar stroke is commonly misdiagnosed [34%] as 
vestibular neuritis.)"
11689,B.
11690,"Like most causes of vertigo, vertigo in vestibular neuritis is 
worsened by head movements."
11691,"But, unlike BPPV, it is not 
solely triggered by head movement."
11692,"It is spontaneous and 
often present even when patients are still."
11693,C. Nausea and vomiting are common.
11694,"D. Patients often have spontaneous nystagmus (occurring with -
out head motion) that is unilateral, horizontal, or horizontal 
and torsional and suppressed by visual fixation."
11695,"Bidirectional 
nystagmus suggests a different (central) disorder."
11696,"E. Gait instability may be present, but patients maintain the 
ability to ambulate."
11697,"However, they should be able to sit or 
stand unaided with their feet spread apart and eyes open 
without falling."
11698,"Severe unsteadiness suggests an alternative 
central process."
11699,F. Patients may fall during Romberg testing.
11700,"G. The neurologic exam should include a cranial nerve exam with 
particular emphasis on extraocular movements, a cerebellar 
exam (including gait), and Romberg sign."

drome is vestibular neuritis, Mr. D’s careful physical exam is 
not consistent with this benign entity but rather suggests a CNS 
process (Figure  14-5)."
11733,"First, his head impulse test is normal."
11734,"As 
noted above, vestibular neuritis typically causes an abnormal  head 
impulse test, so this normal result is worrisome."
11735,"Indeed, a normal 
head impulse test in a patient with the acute vestibular syndrome 
Stern_ch14_p247-p272.indd   257 12/07/19   10:26 am258 / CHAPTER 14
has an LR+ of 17 for CNS disease."
11736,"Additionally, Mr. D has bidirec -
tional nystagmus, which is a CNS finding."
11737,"Focusing on potential 
CNS causes, you recognize that Mr. D is the right age for MS 
(but is at lower risk given his sex and unusual presentation)."
11738,"A 
cerebrovascular accident is possible, although he is young and his 
hypertension has been well controlled."
11739,"A primary intracranial neo -
plasm is also possible; given these alternative hypotheses, neuroim -
aging is required and an MRI is ordered."
11740,"2
The MRI reveals multiple periventricular white matter 
plaques in addition to 1 in the brainstem, highly suggestive 
of MS."
11741,"Alternative Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis
T extbook Presentation
MS typically affects young women of Western European descent 
who experience attacks  of CNS dysfunction that develop over 
days to weeks and then remit partially or completely."
11742,"New attacks 
at different times and in different CNS locations (space) are the 
hallmark of MS.
Disease Highlights
A."
11743,"A multifocal demyelinating disease characterized by CNS 
lesions that develop in different parts of the brain at different 
times."
11744,Lesions may or may not resolve.
11745,"B. Etiology
1."
11746,"MS develops secondary to an inflammatory autoimmune 
disease triggered by environmental agents in genetically 
susceptible patients resulting in multifocal CNS 
demyelination."
11747,2.
11748,"Demyelination may result in neurologic deficits, which can 
be transient if remyelination or axonal adaptation occurs."
11749,3.
11750,Axonal injury may result in irreversible injury.
11751,"C. Epidemiology
1."
11752,"The most common cause of nontraumatic neurologic 
disability in young adults
2."
11753,Women are affected 2–3 times more than men.
11754,3.
11755,"Patients are usually between the ages of 18 and 45 years 
at onset."
11756,4.
11757,"Several studies suggest that late infection (ie, in 
adolescence) with Epstein-Barr virus may increase the 
risk of MS.
D. Symptoms and signs
1."
11758,"Relapse-remitting MS
a."
11759,"Most common clinical course of MS (85%) in which 
a first discrete episode, (a clinically isolated syndrome, 
see below), is followed by recovery and then subsequent 
attacks are followed by full or partial recovery
b."
11760,"Secondary progressive MS, in which progressive 
deterioration occurs with or without acute attacks, 
eventually develops in most of these patients."
11761,2.
11762,"A smaller percentage of patients present with primary 
progressive MS in which steady progression (with or 
without acute attacks) is present at the outset of the disease."
11763,3.
11764,"Clinically isolated syndromes: A symptomatic event due 
to a focal area of CNS demyelination in a patient not previously diagnosed with MS. 20–80% of patients with 
a clinically isolated syndrome develop MS. MRI and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test results greatly aid in the 
diagnosis and risk stratification of MS. Common clinically 
isolated syndromes include:
a."
11765,"Optic neuritis
(1) Presenting complaint in 15–20% of patients
(2) Patients complain of monocular visual loss, 
monocular visual field loss (scotoma), and difficulty 
discerning color that evolves over hours to days."
11766,(3) Pain with extraocular movement is common (92%).
11767,"(4) Afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) is 
almost always seen."
11768,"(5) Fundoscopic exam is normal in two-thirds of 
patients."
11769,"Swelling of the optic nerve may be seen, 
but hemorrhages are rare."
11770,"(6) With long-term follow-up, MS develops in 15–75% 
of patients with optic neuritis (50–80% if the MRI 
scan is abnormal versus 6–22% if the MRI scan 
lacks disseminated features of MS)."
11771,b.
11772,"Partial spinal cord syndromes
(1) Band-like sensation
(2) Varying degrees of pain, light touch, and 
proprioceptive loss
(3) Bilateral sensory loss caudal to a level
(4) Weakness associated with spasticity, extensor plantar 
responses, hyperreflexia, and clonus
(5) Electrical sensation from spine into the limbs that 
occurs with neck flexion (Lhermitte sign)
c. Intranuclear ophthalmoplegia
(1) The medial longitudinal fasciculus coordinates 
conjugate eye movement such that on lateral gaze 
1 eye adducts while the other abducts."
11773,"(2) An intranuclear ophthalmoplegia develops when a 
lesion interrupts the medial longitudinal fasciculus 
pathway."
11774,"(3) On lateral gaze, abduction occurs but adduction in 
the opposite eye is impaired producing diplopia."
11775,Nystagmus develops in the abducting eye.
11776,"(4) Adduction during convergence is maintained, 
distinguishing an intranuclear ophthalmoplegia 
from a third nerve palsy."
11777,"(5) Intranuclear ophthalmoplegia is seen in 33–50% of 
patients with MS.
(6) Intranuclear ophthalmoplegia is not specific for MS; 
it may develop secondary to vascular disease."
11778,"d. Vertigo is the presenting symptom in 5% of patients 
with MS and is reported in 30–50% of patients with 
MS; it is commonly associated with other cranial nerve 
dysfunction."
11779,"e. Up to 33% of patients presenting with a “first” 
demyelinating event have had prior symptoms on 
careful questioning."
11780,"The McDonald criteria suggest 
confirming prior symptomatic attacks with objective 
evidence (eg, abnormal MRI, visual evoked response)."
11781,4.
11782,"Pain is a common and important symptom in MS patients 
with an overall prevalence of 63%."

11789,"Atypical findings that suggest alternative diagnoses 
include age of presentation < 10 years or > 50 years, rapid 
development of neurologic symptoms (within minutes), 
early dementia, delirium, cortical defects (eg, aphasia), 
seizures, a single brain lesion, or a spinal lesion without 
brain lesion."
11790,"E. Infections (viral or bacterial) and live attenuated virus 
vaccinations may trigger attacks."
11791,"(Inactivated vaccines 
are safe.)"
11792,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
11793,"There is no single test that diagnoses MS. Rather, it is the 
integration of clinical, radiologic and supporting laboratory 
information that confirms the diagnosis."
11794,B.
11795,"Prior diagnostic criteria required the demonstration of ≥ 2 
clinical attacks of ≥ 24 hours in duration (in the absence of 
fever or infection), separated in time and in space (different 
CNS locations)."
11796,"The 2017 McDonald criteria are complex

distinction from MS lesions can be complex."
11808,"D. Spinal MRI has similar sensitivity (75–83%) to brain MRI 
but is more specific (97%)."
11809,"Spinal MRI can be particularly 
useful in patients with spinal cord symptoms and in patients

Mrs. S is a 70-year-old woman with a history of depres -
sion and anxiety who complains of dizziness."
11843,"Over the last 
1–2 months she notes increasing intermittent dizziness."
11844,"When asked to describe her dizziness in more detail, she 
has trouble and describes neither vertigo, near syncope, 
nor dysequilibrium."
11845,"She does mention that it seems to 
be worse while standing."
11846,"Mrs. S has also been under more 
stress than usual."
11847,"Her daughter died several years ago and 
her  husband has been chronically ill and is scheduled for 
surgery next month."
11848,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
11849,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
11850,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mrs. S has described ill-defined light-headedness (Figure 14-1)."
11851,"Identifying the cause in such patients is complex because it can 
arise from neurologic, cardiac, or inner ear diseases; be due to 
orthostatic hypotension; or be a symptom of depression and anx -
iety (Figure 14-7)."
11852,"Her psychiatric history and social stressors are 
a clue suggesting she may be suffering from nonspecific dizziness 
due to depression, anxiety, or her social stressors."
11853,"This is the leading 
hypothesis."
11854,"Additionally, Mrs. S mentioned that her symptoms are 
worse while standing, raising the possibility of orthostatic hypoten -
sion."
11855,"Finally, nonspecific dizziness is frequently caused by medica -
tions."

her osteoporosis that she has been taking for years.Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"
11859,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
11860,"Mrs. S. history further increases your suspicion that her symp -
toms are better classified as nonspecific dizziness due in turn to her 
active depression."
11861,She has no incriminating medications.

T extbook Presentation
Ill-defined dizziness is often secondary to a psychiatric disorder

somatization disorder, alcohol dependence, or personality dis -
order."
11863,"The dizziness is often of long duration (years) and poorly 
defined."

mental fuzziness, loss of energy, or a wobbly or a floating sensa -
tion."
11865,"Patients may complain of other associated symptoms partic -
ularly if they have panic attacks, including chest pain, shortness of 
breath, impending sense of doom, palpitations, perioral paresthe -
sias, tingling in the hands and feet, and light-headedness."
11866,"Disease Highlights
A."
11867,"20–38% of patients attending a clinic specializing in dizziness 
demonstrated panic disorder."
11868,B.
11869,"Psychiatric symptoms may develop without any identifiable 
organic cause or develop after episodes of true vertigo or syncope."
11870,"C. Symptoms can be secondary to hyperventilation, which leads 
to hypocapnia resulting in decreased cerebral blood flow."
11871,D. Patients may complain of light-headedness or near syncope.
11872,"E. Milder variants of somatization disorder are more common 
than the full-blown entity."
11873,"Such variants may be precipitated 
by stress or minor physiologic disturbances."

such patients are often disturbed by negative test results rather 
than reassured."
11875,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
11876,"Continuous sensation of vertigo lasting longer than 1–2 weeks 
without daily variation is likely psychogenic."

distinguished from intermittent vertigo, recurring for weeks, 
precipitated by motion."
11878,B.
11879,"One study reported 62% of patients with hyperventilation 
had other significant psychiatric disorders."
11880,"C. Symptom reproduction by induced hyperventilation is

MAKING A DIAGNOSIS

An MRI is performed on Mrs. S and reveals a large 2-cm 
aneurysm at the distal right vertebral artery, compressing 
the medulla, with surrounding edema (Figure 14-8)."
12114,"CASE RESOLUTION
3
Mrs. S was referred to neurosurgery and underwent sur -
gical clipping of her aneurysm."
12115,"Over time her symptoms 
resolved and she returned to full function."
12116,Mrs. S’s case demonstrates several key features.
12117,"First, depressed 
patients often have other serious medical issues and care must 
be taken not to assume their symptoms are always due to their depression."
12118,"Second, although the patient presented with ill-defined 
light-headedness, a more careful review of systems revealed that she 
also had diplopia, which is a highly specific neurologic symptom 
and a critical clue to her CNS disease."
12119,"Although an aneurysm was 
not initially suspected, a methodical approach led to an accurate 
and lifesaving diagnosis."
12120,"Some patients have depression and somatic 
symptoms (including dizziness), whereas others 
have medical illnesses causing their depression, 
anxiety, and dizziness."
12121,"Clinicians should be 
careful when ascribing a patient’s dizziness or 
other symptoms to depression and use clinical 
judgment and follow-up to avoid overlooking 
serious medical illnesses in depressed patients."

As noted in Figure 14-1, the first pivotal decision in patients with 
dizziness is to determine whether the patient is experiencing ver -
tigo, dysequilibrium, near syncope, or ill-defined light-headedness."
12131,Mr.  W has a sensation of motion and therefore has vertigo.
12132,"In 
patients with vertigo, the next pivotal step is to look for neurologic 
signs or symptoms that suggest whether the pathologic process is 
coming from the brainstem or cerebellum (Figure 14-2)."
12133,"His head -
ache makes this an obvious consideration."
12134,"The subset of diseases 
that cause vertigo and headache include migraine with vertigo 
(vestibular migraine), cerebellar hemorrhage, intracranial neoplasm, 
and VAD."
12135,"Clearly, several of these are potentially life-threatening."

Mr. W reports that he has never experienced vertigo before."
12137,"He has an occasional headache that resolves with ibupro -
fen and has never been associated with an aura."
12138,"He has 
no known vascular disease and does not have a history of 
hypertension, diabetes, tobacco use, coagulopathy, atrial 
fibrillation, or cocaine use."
12139,He has no known malignancy.
12140,"Finally, although he feels that it is unrelated, he mentions 
that he saw a chiropractor for cervical adjustment about 
1 hour before his symptoms started."
12141,"He reports that he 
sees his chiropractor regularly and has never had any symp -
toms subsequently."
12142,On exam he looks fairly uncomfortable.
12143,"His vital signs 
are normal except for mild hypertension 140/90 mm Hg."
12144,His cranial nerve exam and gait are normal.
12145,"He has no 
nystagmus or dysmetria."
12146,"The remainder of his exam is 
unremarkable."
12147,"Given Mr. W’s young age and overall health, you wonder if he 
is presenting with a migraine and vertigo."

native hypotheses are potentially life-threatening and are must not 
miss hypotheses."

Classically, migraine sufferers complain of intermittent attacks of 
severe unilateral throbbing headache associated with photophobia, 
phonophobia, nausea and vomiting (see Chapter 20, Headache)."

A."
12190,"Few well-controlled studies have examined the effectiveness of 
therapy for patients with vestibular migraine."
12191,B. Abortive therapy with zolmitriptan may be effective.
12192,"C. Prophylactic therapy with either propranolol, venlafaxine, or 
flunarizine (a calcium channel blocker) appear to be effective 
in patients with recurrent attacks."
12193,"D. See Chapter 20, Headache."
12194,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
4
Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for the leading 
hypothesis, vestibular migraine?"
12195,"Have you ruled out the 
active alternatives?"
12196,"Do other tests need to be done to 
exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
12197,"Mr. W’s prior headache disorder does not sound migrainous 
nor does he have a prior history of headaches associated with 
vertigo, making vestibular migraine unlikely."
12198,"Coupled with the 
life-threatening nature of the alternatives, his evaluation needs 
to continue."
12199,"In particular, cerebellar hemorrhage is imminently 
life-threatening and must be excluded.Cerebellar hemorrhage is a must not miss pos -
sibility that must be considered in all patients 
with headache and vertigo."
12200,"Alternative Diagnosis: Cerebellar Hemorrhage
T extbook Presentation
The textbook presentation of cerebellar hemorrhage is the abrupt 
onset of headache associated with vomiting, ataxia, and vertigo."
12201,"Brainstem compression may produce weakness, cranial nerve 
abnormalities, coma, and death."
12202,"Patients with cerebellar infarc -
tions have similar symptoms."
12203,"Disease Highlights
A. Cerebellar hemorrhage accounts for 5–16% cases of intracere -
bral hemorrhages."
12204,"B. Cerebellar hemorrhage is a neurologic emergency due to the 
potential for hematoma expansion, herniation, and death."
12205,Rapid progression within minutes to hours is common.
12206,1.
12207,"28–38% of patients demonstrate an increase in the 
hematoma on repeat CT scan within 3 hours of onset."

make you revise your leading hypotheses to VAD."
12269,"Revised Leading Hypothesis: Vertebral 
Artery Dissection (VAD)
T extbook Presentation
Unlike patients with atherosclerotic disease, patients with VAD are 
usually younger (mean age 46) and often complain of severe neck 
pain, occipital headache, and evolving neurologic symptoms due to 
progressive involvement of the brainstem."
12270,"Numbness, hemipare -
sis, quadriparesis, coma, a locked-in syndrome, or death can result 
from this uncommon but occasionally devastating illness."

patients younger than age 50."
12276,"B. Pathogenesis
1."
12277,"The vertebral artery passes through foramen within the 
transverse process of C1–C6."
12278,2.
12279,"As C1 rotates on C2, the vertebral artery can be stretched 
and injured, initiating dissection (which may be 
extracranial or intracranial)."

12283,"As blood leaks into the false lumen, the true lumen is 
narrowed, which may lead to rostral thromboembolism."
12284,"The thrombosis may extend to involve the basilar artery 
compromising the entire brainstem."
12285,4.
12286,Infarction is seen in 65%.
12287,5.
12288,"Aneurysm formation can also occur, which may be 
complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage."
12289,C. Stroke develops in 63% of patients.
12290,"A good outcome was 
reported in 69%, fair outcome in 18%, and poor outcome 
in 10%."
12291,D. Risk factors differ from patients with typical ischemic stroke.
12292,"VAD may occur following sporting activities (15% of cases), 
minor trauma, chiropractic manipulation (16% of cases), or 
spontaneously (> 50%)."
12293,1.
12294,"Examples of sporting activities include jogging, horseback 
riding, tennis, skiing, and others."
12295,"Given the frequency with 
which individuals engage in these activities, it is unclear if 
this relationship is causal."
12296,"The average time from the event 
to symptoms is 2–3 days."
12297,2.
12298,"It is also unclear if cervical manipulative therapy 
(CMT) causes VAD or if these dissections preexisted the 
manipulation and patients were seeking CMT to help with 
their pain."
12299,"When associated with CMT, symptoms develop 
within 1 hour of procedure in 83% of patients."

without other neurologic symptoms."
12308,"They may precede 
other neurologic symptoms by hours to weeks."
12309,4.
12310,"The onset of headache and neck pain may be gradual or 
sudden.5."
12311,Neck pain is usually unilateral (≈ 66% of patients).
12312,"Patients 
may have neck tenderness on exam which should not 
remove VAD from consideration."
12313,6.
12314,Isolated vertigo and headache are present in 12% of cases.
12315,"Patients with vertigo and headache or neck pain , 
should be carefully and emergently evaluated."
12316,"Diagnostic possibilities include migraine, sub -
arachnoid hemorrhage, cerebellar hemorrhage, 
and VAD."
12317,"B. Neuroimaging: VAD can be visualized with MRA, CTA, and 
conventional angiography."
12318,1.
12319,"MRA, contrast-enhanced MRI, and CTA are highly 
accurate."
12320,"CTA is preferred for the diagnosis of dissection, 
although MRI is more sensitive at detecting infarction."
12321,2.
12322,"Ultrasonography with color Doppler is less sensitive for 
VAD (66%)."
12323,"Treatment
A."
12324,"For patients with stroke and extracranial cervical arterial 
dissection who meet stringent eligibility criteria for throm -
bolytic therapy, thrombolytics are “probably recommended” 
(2018 AHA/ASA Guideline)."
12325,"Use of thrombolytics in patients 
with intracranial arterial dissection is uncertain and not well 
established."
12326,B.
12327,"For other patients with VAD and ischemic stroke or TIA not 
receiving thrombolytic therapy and without subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, the 2014 AHA/ASA guidelines recommend 
anticoagulation or antithrombotic therapy."
12328,"C. For patients with recurrent ischemic events despite medical 
therapy, endovascular or surgical therapy may be considered."
12329,"D. For patients with aneurysm formation or subarachnoid 
hemorrhage, endovascular repair and surgery have been used."
12330,"CASE RESOLUTION
4
An emergent MRA is performed and reveals a VAD with new 
evidence of thrombosis in the left vertebral artery."
12331,The MRA confirms VAD.
12332,"This unusual but very dangerous 
condition must be treated immediately."
12333,"4
The patient’s new weakness suggests new infarction from 
the VAD."

he is stable and asymptomatic."
12338,"Although CNS causes of vertigo are less common, they must 
be carefully considered in patients with vertigo and neurologic 
symptoms."

REVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES
Meniere Disease
T extbook Presentation
Patients complain of intermittent spells of vertigo."
12342,"They may note 
associated ear fullness, fluctuating unilateral hearing loss, and 
tinnitus."
12343,"Spells typically last for minutes to hours (rarely longer 
than 4–5 hours) and occasionally up to a day."
12344,"Disease Highlights
A."
12345,"Associated with excess fluid (hydrops) in the endolymphatic 
spaces of the inner ear."
12346,B.
12347,The disease may be unilateral or bilateral.
12348,"C. Patients have both episodic sensorineural hearing loss and 
vertigo."
12349,Patients may also experience tinnitus.
12350,1.
12351,Vertigo lasts 20 minutes to 24 hours.
12352,2.
12353,"The hearing loss typically affects lower frequencies initially 
and then progresses."
12354,3.
12355,Tinnitus is often described as low pitch.
12356,4.
12357,Only 38% of patients present with the complete triad.
12358,"Patients may present with any of the 3 symptoms and 
develop the others more than 10 years later."
12359,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
12360,There are no tests that definitely confirm Meniere disease.
12361,"The 
disease is diagnosed clinically."
12362,B.
12363,"Diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Otolaryngol -
ogy and Head and Neck Surgery require the following for a 
definite clinical diagnosis:
1."
12364,"T wo or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo lasting 
> 20 minutes
2."
12365,"Confirmed sensorineural hearing loss
3."
12366,"Tinnitus or perception of aural fullness, or both
4."
12367,Other causes excluded.
12368,"The utilization of other tests is 
controversial."
12369,"A recent review recommended an MRI to 
rule out other causes (ie, acoustic neuroma, cerebrovascular 
accident or MS) before confirming the diagnosis."
12370,"C. Dedicated inner ear MRI
1."
12371,"Dedicated inner ear MRI protocols can demonstrate 
enlargement of the endolymphatic spaces consistent with 
Meniere disease."
12372,"However, enlargement may be seen in 
other conditions and is not specific for Meniere disease."
12373,2.
12374,"Recommended in patients with suspected Meniere disease 
to both exclude other causes of vertigo and to help confirm 
Meniere disease."
12375,3.
12376,"May be especially useful in the subset of patients (20%) 
who present with vertigo or hearing loss suggestive of 
Meniere disease but who have not yet developed the 
classic symptom triad and to distinguish Meniere disease 
from other causes of episodic vertigo such as vertiginous 
migraine."
12377,"Hearing loss may accompany Meniere disease 
or posterior circulation ischemia (due to infarc -
tion of the labyrinth) and is not pathogno -
monic of Meniere disease."
12378,D. Audiometry should be performed.1.
12379,"Early Meniere disease is characterized by low frequency 
sensorineural hearing loss."
12380,2.
12381,Hearing can be normal between attacks.
12382,"E. Test should be done to rule out syphilis (treponemal-specific 
enzyme immunoassay)."
12383,"F. Specialized testing is available (eg, electronystagmogram)."
12384,"Treatment
A. Anecdotal evidence suggests low-salt diet and restriction of 
caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco."
12385,"B. Diuretics and corticosteroids (both oral and intratympanic) 
have been used but their usefulness is unclear."
12386,"Diuretics are 
frequently used when lifestyle changes are inadequate."
12387,"C. Acute vertiginous symptoms can be treated with diphenhy -
dramine, dimenhydrinate, meclizine, benzodiazepines, or 
antiemetics."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. C is a 64-year-old man who comes to see you complain -
ing of shortness of breath."
12534,What is the differential diagnosis of dyspnea?
12535,How would you frame the differential?
12536,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of dyspnea is extraordinarily broad but 
following a structured and sequential approach to the patient 
with dyspnea can allow for the rapid identification of common 
and serious disorders while also ensuring that other causes are not 
missed."
12537,"Heart disease and lung disease constitute the most com -
mon serious causes of dyspnea, specifically heart failure (HF), 
pneumonia, obstructive lung disease (chronic obstructive pul -
monary disease [COPD] and asthma), and pulmonary embolism 
(PE)."
12538,"These four conditions should always be on the differential 
diagnosis for dyspnea and at the forefront of the clinician’s mind 
in evaluating the dyspneic patient."
12539,"A series of other less common 
disorders represent an immediate risk to life and must also be con -
sidered in the very early stages of investigation, as urgent treatment 
may be necessary."
12540,"These diagnoses can be remembered using the 
ACT ASAP mnemonic (Table 15-1)."
12541,"Once these common and life-threatening disorders have been 
considered, a more systematic approach to the many other causes 
of dyspnea can proceed."
12542,"The simplest approach to constructing the 
broad differential diagnosis is to consider the anatomic  components 
of each of these systems, specifically the route of inspired air and 
oxygen through the cardiopulmonary system and the rest of the 
body."
12543,"This allows us to develop a fairly comprehensive differential 
diagnosis of dyspnea."

12571,"Hyperthyroidism
A key issue to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with dys -
pnea is that multiple potential causes are often present in a single 
patient."
12572,"Patients with COPD, for example, are at increased risk for 
pneumonia, pneumothorax, PE, and lung cancer."
12573,"Thus, a patient 
with known COPD presenting with acute dyspnea may have an 
uncomplicated exacerbation of the underlying COPD secondary 
to continued tobacco use, or the worsening symptoms may be sec -
ondary to the development of a complication (such as pneumonia) 
that has also caused an exacerbation of the underlying COPD."
12574,"In this case, both the COPD and the pneumonia are responsible 
for the increase in dyspnea."
12575,"Similarly, patients with HF often have 
or are at risk for other common causes of dyspnea, including con -
comitant valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD."
12576,"The extensive differential diagnosis for dyspnea and the pos -
sibility of several contributory causes necessitates a careful and 
detailed history and physical exam and review of basic laboratory 
exams."
12577,"The history should detail the time course of the dyspnea, 
its severity, and associated symptoms."
12578,"The past medical history 
should cover the predisposing factors for common causes of dys -
pnea (eg, immunosuppression for pneumonia) and the social and 
occupational hazards associated with specific disorders (eg, tobacco 
use for COPD and occupational exposures for interstitial lung 
disease)."
12579,"The physical exam should include vital signs, a detailed 
cardiac and pulmonary exam, and a search for signs suggestive of 
anemia and other systemic diseases."
12580,"In addition, almost all patients 
with new-onset or worsening dyspnea should have a chest film, 
ECG, and hematocrit."
12581,"Unlike some other patient presentations, 
however, there are few individual signs or symptoms whose pres -
ence is highly suggestive of a specific diagnosis or whose absence 
rules out a diagnosis."
12582,"Instead, it is often the combination of history, 
signs and symptoms, augmented by basic testing, that suggests a 
diagnosis (Table 15-2).As is usually the case in diagnosis, the history is the most impor -
tant component of the evaluation of a patient with dyspnea."
12583,"Of 
critical importance is reviewing the risk factors for the causes of 
dyspnea."
12584,"Features that suggest HF , for example, include a history 
of myocardial infarction (MI), CAD risk factors, long-standing 
uncontrolled hypertension, or alcohol abuse."
12585,"PE should be con -
sidered in patients with risk factors, such as recent hospitalization 
or immobilization, surgery, a history of cancer, or use of estrogen."
12586,"In obtaining the history, a focus should be placed on the 
presence of chest pain (covered in Chapter 9), which is a pivotal 
diagnostic clue in patients with dyspnea (Table 15-2)."
12587,"Chest pain 
may be pleuritic or nonpleuritic and acute or chronic/recurrent."
12588,"Each of these features can help focus the differential diagnosis 
(Table 15-3)."
12589,"In general, pleuritic chest pain helps focus the search 
on a pulmonary cause of dyspnea such as pneumonia, PE, and 
pneumothorax."
12590,"Nonpleuritic chest pain evokes a broader differ -
ential and includes both those diseases that cause pleuritic chest 
pain and other etiologies such as MI, aortic stenosis, and aortic 
dissection."
12591,"The acuity of the chest pain can also help narrow the 
differential diagnosis."
12592,"Common causes of dyspnea associated with 
acute chest pain include MI, aortic dissection, PE, pneumothorax, 
arrhythmias (causing angina), and pneumonia."
12593,"Common causes 
of dyspnea associated with chronic/recurrent chest pain include 
angina (caused by CAD, severe anemia, or aortic stenosis), asthma 
or COPD (which are often associated with chest tightness), and 
recurrent intermittent arrhythmias."
12594,"Otherwise there is significant overlap between the presentations 
of the common causes of dyspnea as many symptoms occur in mul -
tiple otherwise seemingly unrelated causes."
12595,"Fever, for example, may 
occur in pneumonia, asthma or COPD with concomitant infec -
tion, valvular heart disease due to endocarditis, PE, acute respira -
tory distress syndrome, and interstitial lung disease."
12596,"Similarly, the 
lack of a fever is only a modestly strong argument against any of 
these disorders as the cause of dyspnea."
12597,"Cough similarly occurs in 
many diseases, including pneumonia, HF , COPD, and interstitial 
lung disease, and is of limited usefulness in terms of differentiating 
among the different causes of dyspnea."
12598,"A detailed physical exam should be particularly focused on 
the presence of key pivotal findings, specifically jugular venous 
distention, S3, egophony with bronchial breath sounds, and 
crackles."
12599,"The presence of jugular venous distention is an impor -
tant discovery and suggests the diagnoses of HF , tamponade or 
PE."
12600,"If an S3 is present in a nonpregnant patient over the age 
of 30, HF is likely."
12601,"Egophony and bronchial breath sounds are 
suggestive of pneumonia."
12602,"The presence of crackles is less specific 
but suggest a pulmonary or cardiac cause and are classically asso -
ciated with pneumonia, HF , and interstitial lung disease."
12603,"Most 
importantly, although the presence of any of these pivotal find -
ings on exam can be helpful, their absence does not rule out any 
of these diagnoses."
12604,"Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly being rec -
ognized as a useful addition to the clinical examination in the 
patient with dyspnea."
12605,"Findings such as the absence of a sliding lung 
(pneumothorax) and B-lines (HF) may substantially increase the 
likelihood of specific disorders."
12606,"Incorporating POCUS findings 
into the evaluation of the dyspneic patient, however, is dependent 
on the availability of an experienced operator (Table 15-4)."
12607,"In most patients, a chest film is necessary to help delineate the 
causes of dyspnea."
12608,"As is the case with other clinical characteris -
tics, however, there is substantial overlap and variability in the 
radiographic findings of disease."
12609,"A normal chest radiograph makes 
pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome unlikely and rules out pneumothorax (Table  15-5)."
12610,"Focal infiltrate(s) suggest pneumonia and can also be seen with 
lung cancer and PE."

Although the differential diagnosis of dyspnea is broad, it is useful

COPD, PE, and pneumonia."

signs immediately focus the differential diagnosis."

of MI is a clear risk factor for HF ."

also reveals a heart murmur raising several alternative diagnoses 
(ie, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, or aortic regurgitation)."
12664,"The location of this murmur is most consistent with mitral regur -
gitation."

lar (LV ) filling or ejection, which may arise from diseases or 
dysfunction of the myocardium, valves, or pericardium."
12674,"The 
remainder of this discussion will focus on myocardial causes 
of HF ."
12675,Valvular heart disease is discussed separately.
12676,B.
12677,"Affects 6.5 million patients in the United States and 
accounts for 900,000 hospitalizations and 75,000 deaths 
annually."
12678,"At age 45, lifetime risk of heart failure is 27.4% 
in men and 23.8% in women."
12679,"The risk of HFrEF is higher 
in men than in women although the risk of HFpEF is equal 
between genders."
12680,"C. Pathophysiologic classification: HF may occur in patients 
with impaired emptying (and an ejection fraction ≤ 40%) or 
impaired filling (with a preserved ejection fraction ≥ 50%)."
12681,"The distinction is important because both the etiologies and 
treatments of these 2 groups are different."
12682,"HF may also be 
classified based on whether the primary process affects the LV 
or the right ventricle (RV)."
12683,1.
12684,"HFrEF
a."
12685,"Previously called systolic HF or systolic dysfunction, 
HFrEF accounts for approximately 50% of cases of HF ."
12686,"b. HFrEF develops when systolic dysfunction impairs LV 
emptying."
12687,c. CAD is the most common cause of HFrEF .
12688,"d. Other common causes include long-standing 
hypertension and alcohol abuse."
12689,"e. Less common causes include viral cardiomyopathy, 
postpartum cardiomyopathy, drug toxicity (eg, 
adriamycin), persistent tachycardia, and idiopathic 
cardiomyopathy."
12690,2.
12691,"HFpEF
a."
12692,"Previously referred to as diastolic HF , HFpEF accounts 
for approximately 50% of all HF cases."
12693,"b. HFpEF develops when an increase in myocardial muscle 
mass (thickness), infiltration, or fibrosis decreases LV 
compliance."
12694,(1) Decreased LV compliance impairs LV filling.
12695,"(2) Note that although LV filling is compromised, 
contractility is preserved and the ejection fraction 
is normal."
12696,c. The most common cause of HFpEF is hypertension.
12697,"d. Less common causes include
(1) Aortic stenosis
(2) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

12740,"Although the presence of any of these should prompt 
consideration of HF , none of the signs or symptoms 
are sensitive enough to rule out HF when absent

12741,"Indeed, even in severe chronic HF (mean 
ejection fraction 18%, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure

12960,"Such patients may not benefit from 
surgery due to irreversible LV dysfunction."
12961,"Furthermore, 
mitral valve repair or replacement increases LV afterload 
(by preventing ejection of blood from the LV to the LA) 
and may worsen HF .3."
12962,"Patients receiving a mechanical  mitral valve replacement

Mrs. L is a 58-year-old woman who arrives at the emer -

Mrs. L ’s shortness of breath is not only severe but markedly worse 
than baseline."
13223,"Both of these features should prompt a thorough 
investigation."
13224,"Unfortunately, the clinical information does not 
suggest any of the most common causes of dyspnea (HF , COPD, 
PE, or pneumonia) (Figure 15-1)."
13225,"Specifically, she has no risk 
factors for HF (CAD, hypertension, or alcohol abuse), no history 
of wheezing, or significant smoking history to suggest asthma or 
COPD, no fever or cough to suggest pneumonia, and no associ -
ated symptoms or risk factors to suggest PE (chest pain, cancer, 
immobilization, prior VTE)."
13226,"She also does not have chest pain that 
can help limit the differential diagnosis."
13227,"A careful exam is vital to 
look for helpful clues."
13228,"2
On physical exam, the patient appears comfortable at rest 
but becomes markedly dyspneic with ambulation."
13229,"Vital 
signs are BP , 140/70 mm Hg; pulse, 72 bpm; temperature, 
37.1°C; RR, 20 breaths per minute."
13230,Conjunctiva are pink.
13231,Lung exam is clear to percussion and auscultation.
13232,"There 
are no crackles or wheezes."
13233,"Cardiac exam reveals a regular 
rate and rhythm."
13234,S1 and S2 are normal.
13235,"There is no JVD, S3, 
S4, or murmur."
13236,There is only trace peripheral edema.
13237,"Abdom -
inal exam is normal."
13238,"A chest radiograph, ECG, and CBC are 
normal."
13239,"Despite a thorough exam, the leading diagnosis is unclear as 
she has none of the pivotal findings (S3, JVD, egophony/bronchial 
breath sounds, crackles) (Figure 15-1)."
13240,"In such cases, it is partic -
ularly important to systematically review the differential diagnosis 
in order to arrive at the correct diagnosis (Table 15-2)."
13241,"Each item 
on the list should be reviewed in light of the history and physi -
cal to determine whether it remains in the differential and should 
be explored further, or whether the existing information makes it 
highly unlikely."
13242,"Reviewing Table 15-2, the absence of a murmur makes mitral 
regurgitation and aortic stenosis unlikely, since the clinical exam 
is 85–90% sensitive for these conditions."
13243,"The clinical exam is less 
sensitive for aortic regurgitation."
13244,"Therefore, aortic regurgitation 
remains on the differential diagnosis."
13245,"An arrhythmia is essentially 
ruled out by the patient’s normal heart rate during  symptoms."
13246,"HF 
is not suggested by the history and physical exam, but it cannot be 
excluded given the low sensitivity of the S3 gallop and JVD."
13247,"The 
patient denies any history of chest pain, but dyspnea is occasion -
ally an anginal equivalent, thus CAD also remains a possibility."
13248,"Pneumonia is highly unlikely given the normal chest film and 
the lack of fever, cough, and crackles."
13249,"Asthma remains a possi -
bility although this is not particularly suggested by the history or 
physical exam."
13250,"COPD is very unlikely given the modest smok -
ing history."
13251,"PE cannot be excluded by the current information 
and remains on the list; although the presentation is not classic 
for PE, the most important determinant of the likelihood of PE 
is the likelihood of other disorders on the differential diagnosis."
13252,"In this case, there are few convincing alternatives, thus increasing 
the likelihood of PE."
13253,"Since PE is associated with a high mortal -
ity, it should also be considered a must not miss possibility."
13254,"A 
significant pleural effusion and pneumothorax are ruled out by 
the normal chest radiograph, which also makes interstitial dis -
ease unlikely (although not impossible)."
13255,"Anemia is ruled out by 
the normal CBC."
13256,"We can now focus on the clinical clues and 
diagnostic tests for these remaining possible diagnoses (aortic 
regurgitation, HF , CAD, asthma, and PE)."
13257,"Table 15-16 lists the 
differential diagnosis.A methodical approach to the differential diag -
nosis is vital whenever the leading diagnosis is 
unclear or when the leading hypothesis cannot 
be confirmed."
13258,"2
In terms of CAD, she denies any history of exertional chest 
pain or pressure and has minimal coronary risk factors."
13259,"(She has no history of diabetes mellitus, no family history 
of CAD, and no recent tobacco use."
13260,"Her last cholesterol 
level was normal [180 mg/dL] with an HDL of 70 mg/dL.)"
13261,"With respect to asthma, she denies any history of wheez -
ing or worsening cough associated with cold, exercise, 
pets, or dust."
13262,"With respect to PE, she denies sudden 
onset of chest pain, chest pain with inspiration, hemop -
tysis, immobilization, cancer, surgery, family history of 
VTE, or leg swelling."
13263,"She does take hormone replacement 
therapy."
13264,"An echocardiogram reveals normal LV function and a 
normal aortic valve."
13265,"Pulmonary function tests reveal normal 
total lung capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1), and single-breath diffusing capacity (DLCO)."

because patients present in a variety of ways and signs and 
symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific."

13282,"Although dyspnea and chest pain are the most common 
symptoms, neither is sufficiently sensitive to rule out the 
diagnosis when absent nor sufficiently specific to rule in 
PE when present."

13284,"No other signs or symptoms are sufficiently sensitive nor 
specific to rule in or out PE (Table 15-17); LR+, 0.3–2;

13285,"The classic presentation of PE is actually the 
exception."
13286,"Patients may have very few symp -
toms."
13287,"A high index of suspicion must be 
maintained for the diagnosis of PE."
13288,"The most 
important consideration is whether an alter -
nate diagnosis is an adequate explanation for 
the patient presentation.Considering each diagnosis in turn, the patient’s physical exam 
and echocardiogram exclude HF and aortic regurgitation."
13289,"The 
patient’s pretest probability of CAD is quite low given her age, sex, 
and risk factors (3.2%; see Chapter 9, Chest Pain)."
13290,"In addition, the 
Framingham data suggest the likelihood of a coronary event in a 
female patient with these CAD risk factors to be just 2% over the 
ensuing 10 years."
13291,"The history and normal pulmonary function tests 
with methacholine challenge make asthma very unlikely."
13292,"Although 
her history, especially the extended presentation, sounds atypical 
for PE, she is taking hormone replacement therapy, a known risk 
factor for VTE."

becomes more probable."

13341,3.
13342,Low D-dimer levels are used to rule out PE.
13343,"It is important 
to emphasize that they need to be used in conjunction with

1."
13374,"Due to the wide range of possible presentations and 
potential life-threatening nature of PE, a large number of 
patients are evaluated for PE (appropriately), which is only 
identified in a minority (~ 20%)."
13375,2.
13376,"Decision rules have been developed that can objectively 
determine the patients pretest probability of disease and 
determine whether patients require no further testing, 
D-dimer testing, or CTA."
13377,"a. PERC rule
(1) Unlike the Wells and Geneva scores, the PERC rule 
is a clinical decision rule designed to use clinical 
criteria to rule out PE in patients with a low pretest 
probability of PE and thereby obviate the need for 
other objective testing (D-dimer or CTA)."
13378,"(2) Patients with none of the following are classified as 
PERC-negative:
(a) Age ≥ 50 years
(b) Heart rate ≥ 100 bpm
(c) SaO2 ≤ 94% on room air
(d) Prior history of VTE, trauma, or surgery in the 
last 4 weeks
(e) Hemoptysis
(f) Exogenous estrogen
(g) Unilateral leg swelling
(3) Meta-analysis of 12 studies and over 14,000 patients 
revealed a LR– of 0.17 in PERC-negative patients 
in patients with a low pretest probability of disease."
13379,"Analysis restricted to studies that used stringent 
diagnostic criteria to rule out a PE revealed that the 
sensitivity of the PERC rule (all findings negative) 
was good but not perfect (96%)."
13380,"(4) Can only be used in in patients with a low clinical 
probability for PE (by Wells or Geneva scores)."
13381,b.
13382,"Wells and Geneva rules
(1) Developed to estimate the pretest probability of PE 
once the decision has been made to test the patient 
for possible PE."
13383,"(2) Not sufficiently accurate to rule PE in or out 
without  additional testing (CTA or D-dimer) 
(LR+ 1.4–3; LR–, 0.24–0.5)."
13384,"(3) Used to risk stratify patients and determine whether 
patients should subsequently undergo CTA or 
simply have a D-dimer level measured."
13385,"(4) Scoring:
(a) Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT: 3 points, 
PE is as likely or more likely than alternative 
diagnoses: 3 points(b) Heart rate > 100 bpm: 1.5 points
(c) Immobilization ≥ 3 days or recent surgery 
(< 4 weeks): 1.5 points
(d) Prior VTE (DVT or PE): 1.5 points
(e) Hemoptysis: 1 point
(f) Active cancer (treated in last 6 months or 
palliative): 1 point
(5) The total score can be used to estimate the patients 
pretest probability and identify the optimal testing 
strategy (Figure 15-4)."
13386,"H. Strategy
1."
13387,"Use the Wells score to estimate the patients’ probability of 
disease; it can be used to stratify patients into 3 categories:
a."
13388,"0–1 point is low probability
b."
13389,"2–6 points is moderate probability
c. > ≥ 7 points is high probability
2."
13390,"The combination of a low probability of PE (by Wells 
score) and either a PERC score of 0 or a negative high-
sensitivity D-dimer effectively rules out PE (Figure 15-4)."
13391,3.
13392,"The combination of a moderate probability of PE (Wells 
score) and a negative high-sensitivity D-dimer effectively 
rules out PE."
13393,"A negative quantitative D-dimer assay in a 
patient with a Wells score of ≤ 4 has a failure rate (missed 
diagnoses) of 0.5%."
13394,4.
13395,"All other patients, including patients with a high 
probability of PE (Wells score ≥ 7) or a positive high-
sensitivity D-dimer, should undergo CTA unless 
contraindicated."
13396,a.
13397,"Positive CTA: effectively confirms the diagnosis of PE
b."
13398,"Negative CTA
(1) Effectively rules out PE in low- to moderate-risk 
patients
(2) Additional testing should be considered in high-risk 
patients (Wells ≥ 7)."
13399,"(3) Options for additional testing include duplex 
leg ultrasonography, indirect CT of the leg veins 
(CT venography), V∙/Q∙ scanning, and pulmonary 
angiography."
13400,"(a) Since a diagnosis of DVT is taken as a 
surrogate marker for the diagnosis of PE, 
duplex leg ultrasonography is the most 
commonly used test in this situation."
13401,"In 
patients with adequate pulmonary reserve, 
serial negative ultrasounds may safely exclude 
the diagnosis of PE and obviate the need for 
further testing
(b) Another alternative to rule out DVT is 
CT venography, which can be performed 
at the same time as CTA."
13402,"However, some 
studies suggest that it is less sensitive than leg 
ultrasound (sensitivity, 60–100%; specificity, 
93–100%)."
13403,"(c) A combined strategy of CTA and duplex leg 
ultrasonography has an excellent negative 
predictive value (≈100%) and is advisable for 
patients with a high likelihood of PE."
13404,5.
13405,"In patients with acute or chronic kidney disease or 
contrast allergy, V∙/Q∙ scanning can be considered in 
place of CTA."

including no difference in calf diameter (LR–, 0.67); lack of 
calf pain (LR–, 0.9); and no Homan sign (LR–, 0.87).The clinical exam for DVT is insensitive."
13424,"Clinicians must have a low threshold for 
ordering D-dimer or duplex studies."
13425,"D. The diagnostic strategy for DVT integrates the pretest prob -
ability of DVT with diagnostic tests of appropriate sensitivity 
to achieve a satisfactory negative predictive value."
13426,"In short, as 
the probability of DVT increases, more sensitive testing strate -
gies need to be used to rule out DVT."

PATIENT  1 
Ms. D is a 33-year-old woman who complains of dysuria for 
4 days."
13717,What is the differential diagnosis of dysuria?
13718,How would you frame the differential?
13719,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Dysuria is pain or burning with or after urination."
13720,"Most patients 
with dysuria have a urinary tract infection (UTI)."
13721,"When consid -
ering this symptom, pivotal points are history and physical exam 
findings that suggest more serious or complicated etiologies."
13722,"Important historical features include vaginal or penile discharge, 
flank pain, rectal/perineal pain, nausea or vomiting, fever, hema -
turia, urinary hesitancy, urinary urgency, nocturia, and urinary fre -
quency."
13723,"On the physical exam, vital signs including temperature 
and sometimes orthostatics are important as are abdominal and 
costovertebral-angle (CVA) tenderness."
13724,"Except in a few situations, 
a pelvic exam should be performed in any woman with a vaginal 
discharge."
13725,"A prostate exam should be performed in any man in

PRIORITIZING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Ms. D is a healthy young woman with symptoms consistent with 
cystitis."
13756,"The pivotal points in this case are the absence of flank pain, 
vaginal discharge, nausea, vomiting, or fever."
13757,"Vaginitis is a com -
mon disease that can cause similar symptoms, and pyelonephritis 
is a must not miss diagnosis."

temperature, and absence of abdominal or CVA tenderness."

diagnosis?"

you need?"
13762,"Leading Hypothesis: Cystitis
T extbook Presentation
Cystitis typically presents with dysuria or suprapubic pain or both."
13763,"Often, there is associated urinary frequency, urgency, or hematuria."
13764,"There is usually no penile or vaginal discharge, CVA tenderness, 
nausea, vomiting, or fever."

for acute prostatitis."
14037,"Treatment
A. First-line antibiotics include a fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX."

should also be given."
14039,B.
14040,"While nitrofurantoin is used to treat cystitis, it is ineffective in 
prostatitis because it does not penetrate the prostate well."
14041,C. The duration of antibiotics should be at least 4–6 weeks.
14042,"D. T reatment with pain medications and stool softeners are also 
helpful."
14043,"E. Patients with severe infection or medically complex patients 
should be admitted for IV antibiotic therapy."
14044,"F. Patients who do not respond to treatment should be evaluated 
for a prostatic abscess."
14045,"Although a prostatic abscess may be 
palpable on exam, CT, MRI, or transrectal ultrasonography 
are required to confirm diagnosis."
14046,"Drainage or resection can 
be necessary."
14047,G. Prostatitis will elevate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mrs. V is a 62-year-old woman with leg edema for the past 
2 weeks."
14197,What is the differential diagnosis of edema?
14198,How would you frame the differential?
14199,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Edema is defined as an increase in the interstitial fluid volume and 
is generally not clinically apparent until the interstitial volume has 
increased by at least 2.5–3 L. It is useful to review some background 
pathophysiology before discussing the differential diagnosis:
A."
14200,"Distribution of total body water
1."
14201,"67% intracellular; 33% extracellular
2."
14202,"Extracellular water: 25% intravascular; 75% interstitial
B."
14203,"Regulation of fluid distribution between the intravascular and 
interstitial spaces
1."
14204,"There is a constant exchange of water and solutes at the 
arteriolar end of the capillaries."
14205,2.
14206,"Fluid is returned from the interstitial space to the 
intravascular space at the venous end of the capillaries and 
via the lymphatics."
14207,3.
14208,"Movement of fluid from the intravascular space to the 
interstitium occurs through several mechanisms:
a. Capillary hydrostatic (hydraulic) pressure pushes fluid 
out of the vessels."
14209,"b. Interstitial oncotic pressure pulls fluid into the 
interstitium."
14210,"c. Capillary permeability allows fluid to escape into the 
interstitium."
14211,4.
14212,"Movement of fluid from the interstitium to the intravascular 
space occurs when opposite pressures predominate."
14213,"a. Intravascular (plasma) oncotic pressure from plasma 
proteins pulls fluid into the vascular space."
14214,"b. Interstitial hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of the 
interstitium."
14215,5.
14216,"In skeletal muscle, the capillary hydrostatic pressure and the 
intravascular oncotic pressure are the most important factors."
14217,6.
14218,"There is normally a small gradient favoring filtration out of 
the vascular space into the interstitium; the excess fluid is 
removed via the lymphatic system.C."
14219,"Edema formation occurs when there is
1."
14220,"An increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure (for example, 
increased plasma volume due to renal sodium retention)."
14221,2.
14222,"An increase in capillary permeability (for example, burns, 
angioedema)."
14223,3.
14224,"An increase in interstitial oncotic pressure (for example, 
myxedema)."
14225,4.
14226,"A decrease in plasma oncotic pressure (for example, 
hypoalbuminemia)."
14227,5.
14228,Lymphatic obstruction.
14229,"Although it is possible to construct a pathophysiologic frame -
work (Figure 17-1) for the differential diagnosis of edema, it is

The peripheral and vasodilatation hypothesis states that as cirrhosis progresses, systemic vasodilatation from reduced systemic  vascular 
resistance and the sequestration of fluid into the peritoneal cavity result in arterial underfilling and activation of salt-ret aining neurohormonal 
mechanisms such as the sympathetic nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system to counteract low arterial blood  
pressures."
14386,"Consequently, although plasma and blood volume are increased, effective arterial blood volume is decreased."

Hb,  10.5 g/dL; HCT, 31%; MCV, 86 mcm3; platelet, 
123,000/mcL; electrolytes normal; BUN, 8 mg/dL; cre -

ALT, 102 units/L; AST, 66 units/L; PT/PTT normal; urinaly -
sis, 2+ protein with no cells or casts."
14489,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension?"
14490,"Have you ruled out the active 
alternatives?"
14491,"Do other tests need to be done 
to exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
14492,"The physical exam findings of splenomegaly and ascites, along with 
the laboratory abnormalities of thrombocytopenia, elevated tran -
saminases, and hypoalbuminemia, are all consistent with chronic 
liver disease."
14493,"The absence of pulmonary crackles and elevation of 
the jugular venous pressure make HF unlikely."
14494,"However, the find -
ings of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia are also consistent with 
nephrotic syndrome."
14495,"Alternative Diagnosis: Nephrotic Syndrome

membranous and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
(33% each), with membranous being more common in 
white patients and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
more common in black patients."
14499,"c. Less common pathologies found in adults are minimal 
change disease (15%) and membranoproliferative 
glomerular disease (including IgA nephropathy) (14%)."
14500,"d. In patients over age 65 who undergo kidney biopsy 
(recognizing that many patients with presumed diabetic 
nephropathy do not have a biopsy), approximately 
15% have minimal change disease, 30–40% have 
membranous nephropathy, and 10–12% have

lithium, and heroin, can cause nephrotic syndrome."
14510,B.
14511,"Clinical consequences
1."
14512,"Primary sodium retention by the kidney, related to 
low effective circulating volume, causes edema and

PATIENT 2
Mrs. E is a 62-year-old woman with a long history of hyper -
tension that is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, 
metoprolol, and amlodipine."
14553,"She comes in today with a new 
complaint of swelling in her legs and feet for several weeks."
14554,"It is generally most noticeable late in the day and is often 
absent when she first gets up in the morning."
14555,"She has no 
history of liver or kidney disease or alcohol use."
14556,"She has no 
chest pain and no shortness of breath, although notes she 
finds it tiring to climb stairs or walk more than a few blocks."
14557,"She smoked a few cigarettes a day for 20 years, but quit 
20 years ago."
14558,"Her physical exam is notable for a BMI of 38, clear lungs, 
an S4 with no S3 or murmurs, and a normal abdomen."
14559,"Her 
legs show 1+ edema to the knees bilaterally."
14560,"She has a long-
standing goiter that is unchanged from previous exams."
14561,"It 
is difficult to identify her jugular venous pressure due to the 
shape of her neck."

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
14563,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
14564,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Once again, given the pivotal finding of bilateral edema, the 
first step is to look for systemic causes, focusing first on cardiac, 
hepatic, and renal causes."
14565,"Mrs. E’s long-standing history of hyper -
tension raises the possibility of diastolic dysfunction, and the lack 
of physical exam findings does not rule this out."
14566,"While she does 
have long-standing hypertension, there are no clinical clues to 
suggest advanced liver or kidney disease; however, these are easy 
to test for and should always be ruled out."
14567,"Amlodipine commonly 
causes edema, but she has taken it for years without symptoms."
14568,"“Dependent edema,” edema that is worsened by standing and improves or resolves with leg elevation, is consistent with, but not 
specific for, venous insufficiency."
14569,"A final consideration would be 
pulmonary hypertension."
14570,"Patients with pulmonary hypertension 
commonly complain of dyspnea in addition to edema, and the 
tired feeling she experiences with exertion could represent dyspnea."

PATIENT 3
Mrs. K is a 64-year-old woman who had a right mastec -
tomy 2 years ago for breast cancer."
14730,"She was treated with 
adjuvant radiation therapy and has been taking tamoxifen 
since completing the radiation."
14731,"She has had no evidence of 
recurrent disease but has had some right arm swelling for 
at least 18 months."
14732,"She comes to see you now because 
2  days ago the swelling of her right arm worsened, with 
associated pain and redness."
14733,"This morning her temperature 
was 37.9°C."
14734,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
14735,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
14736,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mrs. K has unilateral limb edema, a key pivotal point limiting the 
differential."
14737,"Exploring her history, it is notable that she has chronic 
lymphedema due to disruption of lymphatic drainage by her pre -
vious surgery and radiation therapy."
14738,"This is an important clinical 
clue, since patients with lymphatic disruption and lymphedema are 
at high risk for skin and subcutaneous infections."
14739,"Pathophysiolog -
ically, the edema found in cellulitis is due to a localized increase in 
capillary permeability due to inflammation; however, patients with 
underlying limb abnormalities will often present with more diffuse 
edema."
14740,"The other primary consideration in any patient with uni -
lateral limb swelling is DVT."
14741,"Mrs. K has several risk factors for this, 
including history of cancer, possible venous scarring secondary to 
radiation, and use of tamoxifen (a drug associated with a relative 
risk for DVT of about 3)."
14742,Table 17-8 lists the differential diagnosis.
14743,"Always think about DVT in a patient with 
unilateral limb swelling."
14744,"3
On physical exam, Mrs. K is clearly uncomfortable."
14745,"Her 
temperature is 38.3°C, pulse 102 bpm, RR 16 breaths 
per minute, and BP 125/80 mm Hg."
14746,"Her right upper arm 
and chest are bright red, hot, and tender."
14747,"The border of the 
erythema is sharply demarcated, and the area of erythema 
feels indurated."

multiple areas of cracked skin."

I have a patient with fatigue."
14990,"How do I 
determine the cause?"
14991,"CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Mrs. M is a 42-year-old woman who has had fatigue for the 
past 6 months."
14992,What is the differential diagnosis of fatigue?
14993,How would you frame the differential?
14994,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Before considering the differential diagnosis, it is important to 
understand what the patient means by fatigue, which is conven -
tionally defined as a sensation of exhaustion after usual activities, 
or a feeling of insufficient energy to begin usual activities."
14995,"Most 
people consider the terms fatigue, tiredness, and lack of energy 
synonymous."
14996,"However, patients sometimes use these terms when 
they are actually experiencing other symptoms, especially excessive 
sleepiness, weakness, or dyspnea on exertion."
14997,"Always ask patients what they mean when they 
report fatigue."
14998,"Always ask directly about weak -
ness, excessive sleepiness, and dyspnea."
14999,"Acute fatigue is common in conjunction with a variety of acute ill -
nesses, ranging from uncomplicated viral infections to exacerbations 
of heart failure (HF)."
15000,"Fatigue is also a prominent symptom in some 
chronic diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and cancer."
15001,"This chapter 
will not discuss fatigue in such patients but will focus on evaluating 
the symptom of fatigue lasting weeks to months in patients without 
already diagnosed conditions known to cause fatigue."

atric disorders, sleep disorders, and medication 
side effects."
15025,"1
Mrs. M reports that she is tired all the time, beginning first 
thing in the morning and lasting all day."
15026,"She also reports 
frontal headaches several mornings per week, intermittent 
lower abdominal pain relieved by bowel movements, and low 
back pain."
15027,She does not complain of any trouble sleeping.
15028,"Her past medical history is notable for menorrhagia 
and iron deficiency anemia when she was in her 20s and is 
otherwise unremarkable."
15029,"Currently, her menses occur every 
30 days, with bleeding for 3–4 days."
15030,"Her family history is 
notable for thyroid disease in her mother and breast cancer 
in her paternal grandmother."
15031,"She takes no medications, does not smoke, and does 
not drink alcohol."
15032,She has never used illicit drugs.
15033,"She works 
as a teacher, and her husband is a security guard."
15034,"They have 
2 children, ages 9 and 12."
15035,"She does not report any recent 
changes at home or work."

what are the active alternatives, and is there a

RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
A specific causative medical disease (other than psychiatric dis -
ease and sleep disorders) that explains fatigue is found in less than 
10% of patients who seek medical attention from their primary 
care physician."
15038,"Up to 75% of patients with fatigue have psychi -
atric symptoms."
15039,"Sleep disorders, especially OSA and insomnia 
syndromes, are also common in patients with fatigue, and in one 
referral clinic, 80% of patients with fatigue had sleep disorders."
15040,"Because the differential diagnosis of fatigue is broad and difficult 
to limit during the initial assessment, it is necessary to explore for 
symptoms and signs of many possible etiologies in most patients, 
even those with pivotal psychiatric or sleep disorder symptoms."
15041,"Patients with several somatic complaints, such as Mrs. M, are par -
ticularly likely to have psychiatric causes for fatigue, as are patients 
who feel tired constantly."
15042,"Because sleep disorders are so common, 
either in association with psychiatric disorders or alone, they are 
always an active alternative in patients with fatigue."
15043,"Patients often 
do not spontaneously describe sleep disturbances and psychiatric 
symptoms, so it is important to ask about them directly."
15044,"All patients with fatigue need a detailed 
psychosocial and sleep history."
15045,"Although most patients with fatigue do not have anemia, hypo -
thyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, these conditions are important 
and treatable, and so are generally considered “must not miss” diag -
noses."
15046,"Anemia and hypothyroidism are somewhat likely in Mrs. M 
because of her previous history of anemia and her family history of Table 18-1."
15047,Medications that affect sleep.
15048,"Medications that 
cause insomniaAntidepressants: Bupropion, venlafaxine, 
fluoxetine, sertraline
  Anticholinergics: Ipratropium
  CNS stimulants: Methylphenidate, modafinil
  Hormones: Oral contraceptives, thyroid hormone, 
corticosteroids, progesterone
  Sympathomimetic amines: Albuterol, theophylline, 
phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine
  Antineoplastics: Leuprolide, goserelin, 
pentostatin, interferon alfa
  Miscellaneous: Phenytoin, nicotine, levodopa, 
quinidine, caffeine, alcohol
Medications that 
cause drowsinessTricyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, 
imipramine, nortriptyline
  Other antidepressants: Mirtazapine, trazodone,

  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  Neuropathic pain agents: Gabapentin, pregabalin
  Alcohol
  Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, 
meclizine
  Atypical antipsychoticsthyroid disease."
15049,"Finally, on occasion, fatigue may be the presenting 
symptom in patients with undiagnosed cardiac, pulmonary, renal, 
liver, rheumatologic, or chronic infectious disease."
15050,"Table 18-2 lists 
the differential diagnosis."
15051,"Despite the rarity of positive results, most 
patients with fatigue need basic laboratory 
testing consisting of a blood count, chemistry 
panel (including glucose, electrolytes, blood 
urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, calcium, and 
liver biochemical tests), and a thyroid-stimulat -
ing hormone (TSH) test."
15052,"1

depressed."
15053,She has not lost or gained weight.

15180,"Treatment
A. CBT addresses dysfunctional beliefs and behaviors about sleep 
and is considered first-line treatment for all patients with 
insomnia."
15181,"When compared to pharmacologic therapy, CBT 
has a similar effect but is better sustained."
15182,"CBT includes the 
following components:
1."
15183,"Stimulus control
a."
15184,"Also known as sleep hygiene
b."
15185,"Based on premise that insomnia is a conditioned 
response to temporal and environmental cues
c. Has been shown to be effective for sleep onset and 
maintenance
d. Principles of sleep hygiene
(1) Go to bed only when sleepy."
15186,"(2) Use the bedroom only for sleep and sex, not reading, 
watching television, eating, working, or using a 
computer
(3) If unable to sleep after 20 minutes in bed, get out 
of bed, go into another room, read or listen to quiet 
music, and then return to bed when sleepy."
15187,"(4) Maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule; go to 
bed and get up at the same time each day."
15188,"(5) Avoid daytime napping; if napping is necessary, 
limit the nap to less than 30 minutes and take the 
nap no later than the early afternoon."
15189,"(6) Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other stimulants (such 
as decongestants)."
15190,(7) Exercise regularly but not in the late evening.
15191,2.
15192,"Relaxation therapy
a."
15193,"Methods include progressive muscle relaxation, 
biofeedback to reduce somatic arousal, imagery training, 
and meditation."
15194,b.
15195,"Useful for both sleep onset and maintenance
c. Often requires practice with a trained professional
3."
15196,"Sleep restriction
a. Decreases the amount of time spent in bed in order to 
increase the percentage of time in bed spent sleeping
b."
15197,"Usually keep waking time constant and make bedtime 
later, with progressive moving up of bedtime as sleep 
improves
c. Effective for sleep onset and maintenance
4."
15198,"Cognitive therapy involves identifying dysfunctional beliefs 
about sleep and then substituting more functional attitudes 
that can reduce anxiety."
15199,"B. Pharmacotherapy
1."
15200,"Most studies of pharmacologic agents are short  
(12 days to 6 months), so data about long-term effects  
are lacking.2."
15201,"Basic principles for using pharmacotherapy to treat chronic 
insomnia
a."
15202,"Use agents with shorter half-lives to minimize daytime 
sedation."
15203,b.
15204,Use the lowest effective dose.
15205,"c. T ry to dose intermittently, such as 2–4 times per week, 
rather than daily."
15206,"d. Use for the minimum duration possible and try to limit 
daily use to a maximum of 3–4 weeks."
15207,e. Discontinue medication gradually.
15208,"f. Monitor for rebound insomnia when medications are 
stopped."
15209,"g. Side effects, including delirium, are more likely to occur 
in elderly patients."
15210,h. Commonly used sleep aids are summarized in Table 18-3.
15211,"C. Pharmacologic therapy versus CBT
1."
15212,Data comparing pharmacotherapy with CBT are limited.
15213,a.
15214,"Overall, treatment effects of CBT, pharmacotherapy, 
and combined therapy are similar."
15215,b.
15216,More sustained improvement with CBT long-term.
15217,c. More adverse effects with pharmacotherapy.
15218,"d. Lack of evidence to support the use of combined 
therapy routinely."
15219,"e. Many patients will improve with CBT without the use 
of medication."
15220,"Alternative Diagnosis: Obstructive Sleep Apnea
T extbook Presentation
Patients with OSA often complain of daytime sleepiness or fatigue."
15221,Bed partners often note snoring or actual apneic episodes.
15222,"Most 
patients are obese."
15223,"Disease Highlights
A."
15224,"Characterized by repetitive episodes of complete or partial 
upper airway obstruction during sleep that results in desatura -
tion in oxyhemoglobin and sleep fragmentation."
15225,1.
15226,"An obstructive apnea is at least 10 seconds of cessation of 
ventilation accompanied by respiratory efforts."
15227,2.
15228,"A hypopnea is at least a 30% reduction in airflow for 
10 seconds or longer with at least a 4% reduction in oxygen 
saturation."
15229,3.
15230,"A respiratory effort related arousal is an occurrence of 
disordered breathing that does not meet criteria for apnea 
or hypopnea but does cause arousal."
15231,4.
15232,"The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is the total number 
of apneas plus hypopneas per hour; the respiratory 
disturbance index (RDI) includes apneas, hypopneas, and 
respiratory effort related arousals."
15233,"a. OSA is defined as an AHI or RDI ≥ 5 with daytime 
somnolence, or an AHI or RDI ≥ 15 regardless of 
symptoms."
15234,b.
15235,"Mild OSA is an AHI or RDI of 5–14; moderate is an 
AHI or RDI of 15–29, and severe is an AHI or RDI ≥30."
15236,B.
15237,"Prevalence of OSA
1."
15238,"When OSA is defined as an AHI ≥ 5 with symptoms or 
an AHI ≥ 15, the prevalence is 15% in men and 5% in 
women."
15239,2.
15240,The prevalence is 50% in referral populations.

C. Pathophysiology
1."
15242,"There are normal decreases in tonic pharyngeal muscle 
tone and compensatory reflex dilators during sleep."
15243,2.
15244,"Patients with OSA have smaller upper airways due 
to increased parapharyngeal fat, tongue prominence, 
elongated palate, or thickened lateral pharyngeal walls, 
and are unable to maintain airway stability."
15245,3.
15246,"During inspiration, the negative upper airway pressures 
close these narrowed airways, resulting in apneas or 
hypopneas."
15247,"D. Risk factors
1."
15248,"Obesity
a."
15249,"The strongest risk factor for OSA
b."
15250,"There is a 6-fold increase in the risk of OSA with a 10% 
weight gain."
15251,"c. Enlarged neck circumference, a measurement of upper 
body obesity, is a predictor of OSA (>16 inches in 
women, >17 inches in men)."
15252,2.
15253,Sex: OSA is 2–3 times more common in men than women.Table 18-3.

15355,"B. Etiology
1."
15356,"Primary hypothyroidism: failure of the thyroid gland to 
produce adequate thyroid hormone
a."
15357,"Most common cause in iodine sufficient areas is chronic 
autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis
(1) Both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated 
destruction of the thyroid gland
(2) Autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase, 
thyroglobulin, and TSH receptor
(3) Patients may or may not have a goiter on 
presentation."
15358,"b. Iodine deficiency is a common cause worldwide; 
patients have large goiters."
15359,"c. Thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy both cause 
hypothyroidism."
15360,"(1) Patients with partial thyroidectomy may not need 
replacement but should be monitored annually; 
hypothyroidism will develop in 20%."
15361,"(2) Postablative hypothyroidism develops several weeks 
after the radioactive iodine therapy in about 80% 
of patients."
15362,"d. Can develop years later in patients who have undergone 
external neck radiation
e. Amiodarone (14% of patients) and lithium (6% of 
patients) commonly cause hypothyroidism
f. Less common etiologies include infiltrative diseases, 
such as sarcoidosis, and thyroid agenesis."

15364,"Central hypothyroidism: reduction in TSH due to pituitary 
or hypothalamic disorder
a."
15365,"Accounts for < 1% of cases of hypothyroidism
b. Pituitary adenoma is the most common cause; also 
can occur post neurosurgery or brain radiation or as a 
complication of postpartum hemorrhage
c. Granulomatous diseases, especially sarcoidosis, can 
infiltrate the hypothalamus."

15376,"The TSH is the best screening test for both primary hypothy -
roidism and hyperthyroidism; it is not necessary to measure 
thyroid hormone levels initially unless central hypothyroidism 
is suspected."
15377,1.
15378,"TSH does have circadian fluctuations, with higher levels 
toward the evening."
15379,2.
15380,"TSH levels tend to be higher in the winter and spring than 
in the summer and autumn."
15381,"C. If the TSH is normal, no further testing is necessary (LR– for 
hypothyroidism is < 0.01)."
15382,"D. If the TSH is elevated (LR+ for hypothyroidism is > 99), the 
free T4 should be ordered next."
15383,1.
15384,"Most of T4 is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin and 
albumin."
15385,2.
15386,"The levels of these binding proteins are affected by a variety 
of medical conditions, thus altering the level of total T4."
15387,3.
15388,"Free T4 better reflects the patient’s thyroid function than 
total T4."
15389,"To assess thyroid function, order a TSH fol -
lowed by a measurement of free T4; do not 
order a total T4."
15390,"It is not necessary to order a T3 
when evaluating patients for hypothyroidism."
15391,"E. If the TSH is elevated, and the free T4 is decreased, the patient 
has overt hypothyroidism and should be treated."
15392,"F. If the TSH is elevated and the free T4 is normal, the patient 
has subclinical hypothyroidism."
15393,1.
15394,"The TSH and free T4 should be repeated to confirm the 
diagnosis."
15395,2.
15396,"The most common cause is chronic autoimmune 
(Hashimoto) thyroiditis."
15397,3.
15398,"The overall prevalence is 4–8% but is up to 20% in women 
over 60."
15399,4.
15400,"The progression rate to overt hypothyroidism is 4–18% 
per year; progression is more likely in patients with higher 
levels of TSH and positive thyroid antibodies."
15401,5.
15402,"A meta-analysis of more than 55,000 participants found 
an increased risk of coronary heart disease events (relative 
risk 1.89) and coronary heart disease mortality (relative 
risk 1.58) in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and 
a TSH ≥ 10 microunit/mL; whether treatment lowers this

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. T is a 66-year-old man who arrives at the emergency 
department with bloody stools and dizziness."
15490,"His symp -
toms started 2 hours ago."
15491,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
GI bleeding?"
15492,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
15493,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The approach to GI bleeding is similar to the approach to other 
potentially life-threatening illnesses."
15494,"Patient stabilization, specifi -
cally, hemodynamic stabilization is the first step in management."
15495,"In 
a patient with significant GI bleeding, management precedes diag -
nosis, usually made by colonoscopy or esophagogastroduodenos -
copy (EGD)."
15496,"The pivotal point in the differential, post stabilization, 
is distinguishing between an upper or lower GI source for blood 
loss."
15497,"From there, by using severity of the bleed, patient demograph -
ics and assessing risk factors for bleeding sources, one can narrow 
down the differential further."
15498,Initial management follows a regimented course.
15499,"First, the 
patient must have a risk assessment for the severity of bleeding 
and preparation must be made for resuscitation if further bleed -
ing occurs."
15500,"This is followed by hemodynamic stabilization and 
completion of initial diagnostic and therapeutic testing."
15501,A.
15502,"Risk assessment
1."
15503,"The best risk assessment tool for upper GI bleed is the 
Glasgow-Blatchford Score."
15504,a.
15505,"The score includes variables such as blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), hemoglobin, blood pressure, heart rate."
15506,b.
15507,"Low scores identify low-risk patients who potentially 
can be treated as an outpatient."
15508,"c. A score of 0 has LR– of 0.02 for need for urgent 
endoscopic intervention equating to a very low-risk 
patient."
15509,2.
15510,"For lower GI bleeding, the following patient factors 
predict poor outcomes (increased risk of mortality, adverse 
outcomes or re-bleeding):
a."
15511,"Initial hematocrit < 35%; OR 6.3
b."
15512,"Age > 60; OR 4.2
c. Gross blood on rectal exam; OR 3.9
d. Heart rate > 100 bpm; OR 3.7
e. Systolic pressure blood pressure < 100 mm Hg; OR 3.0B."
15513,"Preparation for hemodynamic stabilization, resuscitation, and 
further bleeding
1."
15514,"All patients should have their blood typed and be cross-
matched for at least 2 units of packed red blood cells."
15515,2.
15516,"T wo large bore IVs
a. IVs should be ≤ 16 gauge."
15517,b.
15518,"Because flow = ΔP (πr4/8μL) (where ΔP is the pressure 
differential, r is the radius of the IV, μ is the viscosity 
of the fluid, and L is the length of the IV), flow can be 
maximized by
(1) Increasing the pressure behind the fluid being 
infused (squeezing the bag)."
15519,(2) Decreasing the length of the IV.
15520,"(3) Increasing the gauge of the IV (the most effective 
as the flow goes up by the fourth power of any 
increase)."
15521,"c. Large gauge IVs (16 and larger) are much more effective 
than central lines for volume resuscitation."
15522,"Always make sure your patient has 2 usable 
large bore IVs, so you do not have to worry 
about IV access should life-threatening 
bleeding develop."
15523,"d. In the setting of severe hemorrhage, a urinary catheter, 
with regular monitoring of urinary output, helps 
monitor the adequacy of volume resuscitation."
15524,"C. Hemodynamic stabilization
1."
15525,Clinically assess volume status.
15526,a.
15527,"Signs of shock may be seen with 30–40% volume 
depletion."
15528,b. Orthostasis can be seen with 20–25% volume depletion.
15529,c. Tachycardia may be present with 15% volume depletion.
15530,2.
15531,"Calculate necessary replacement (weight in kg × 0.6 (lean 
body weight made up of water) × % volume depletion)."
15532,3.
15533,"Replace fluid losses initially with normal saline or Ringer 
solution."
15534,4.
15535,Consider the need for blood transfusion.
15536,a.
15537,"There is general agreement on the following 
recommendations for transfusion in actively bleeding 
patients."
15538,"(1) Patients should receive a blood transfusion 
when there has been 30% loss of blood volume 
(manifested by tachycardia, hypotension, 
tachypnea, decreased urinary output, or CNS 
symptoms [eg, anxiety/confusion]).I have a patient with GI bleeding."
15539,"How do I 
determine the cause?"
15540,"Deepa Rani Nandiwada, MD, MS
Stern_ch19_p339-p350.indd   339 12/07/19   12:18 pm340 / CHAPTER 19
(2) Alternatively, if 2 L of crystalloid have been given 
without successful resuscitation, blood should be 
transfused."
15541,"(3) If a Hb level is available, actively bleeding patients 
should receive a transfusion when the level falls 
below 9 g/dL because it can take time for the Hb 
to accurately reflect ongoing blood loss."
15542,"(4) If large amounts of blood are needed (> 4 units of 
packed red blood cells), fresh frozen plasma and 
platelets should also be given."
15543,b.
15544,"In patients who are not bleeding, withholding 
transfusions until the Hb is < 7 g/dL is appropriate."
15545,"(1) This recommendation is based mainly on a study 
that demonstrated a mortality benefit associated 
with a restrictive transfusion strategy."
15546,"(2) The exclusion criteria in this study were massive 
exsanguinating bleeding, an acute coronary 
syndrome, symptomatic peripheral vasculopathy, 
stroke, or transient ischemic attack."
15547,"(3) All patients had endoscopy within 6 hours of 
presentation."
15548,"(4) Patients in this study also received blood if 
symptoms of anemia or massive bleeding developed 
or if they required surgery."
15549,"c. In patients with cardiovascular disease, a transfusion 
threshold of 8 g/dL is probably appropriate."
15550,"d. It is important to remember that patients may initially 
have a normal hemoglobin level when they present with 
an acute hemorrhage."
15551,"Hemoglobin level will only fall 
after fluid resuscitation."
15552,"Even after a large hemorrhage, patients may 
initially have a normal Hb level."
15553,"The level will 
only fall after fluid resuscitation."
15554,"5. Review the patient’s medication list for antiplatelet 
and anticoagulant medications."
15555,"The decision to reverse 
an anticoagulant is based on a careful balancing of the 
severity of bleeding versus the need for anticoagulation."
15556,6.
15557,"If there is concern for an upper GI bleed, empirically 
start an IV proton pump inhibitor or octreotide or both 
based on risk factors for peptic ulcer disease and variceal 
bleeding."
15558,"a. IV proton pump inhibitors help reduce the number of 
endoscopic interventions and risk of re-bleeds in peptic 
ulcer disease without a mortality benefit."
15559,b.
15560,"Intermittent IV or oral bolus dosing of proton 
pump inhibitors is probably equivalent, if not 
superior to, continuously delivered proton pump 
inhibitor."

corticosteroids) may have free air in the abdomen 
with only mild abdominal symptoms."
15570,"c. Radiographs may, infrequently, provide other 
diagnostic clues."
15571,6.
15572,"Nasogastric (NG) tube placement, which was once 
considered standard, is now controversial."
15573,a.
15574,"An NG tube is a minimally invasive way to assess the 
acuity of bleeding and to help localize its source."
15575,b.
15576,"Blood or coffee grounds in an NG aspirate is indicative 
of an upper GI bleed (LR+, 9.6)."
15577,"c. On the other hand, a negative lavage does not exclude 
an upper GI source."
15578,"d. Research has suggested that NG tube placement does 
not change patient outcomes (mortality, length of stay, 
volume of transfused blood, need for surgery)."
15579,"The differential diagnosis of GI bleeding is based on an ana -
tomic framework."
15580,"Upper GI bleeds originate proximal to the lig -
ament of T reitz, while lower GI bleeds originate from areas distal 
to the ligament and are primarily colonic."
15581,"Therefore, the pivotal 
points in a patient’s evaluation are characteristics that argue for an 
upper or lower GI source."
15582,"Among others, these include history of 
previous upper or lower bleeding episodes, epigastric pain, melena, 
and blood in an NG lavage, all of which suggest an upper GI bleed."
15583,"The causes of upper and lower GI bleeding are arranged below in 
the approximate order of frequency."
15584,"Bleeding from a small bowel 
source is less common."

15598,He did not have nausea.
15599,"He went to the bathroom and passed a large bowel move -
ment of stool mixed with blood."
15600,"Afterward, he felt better 
and went to lie down."

same sensation and this time passed what he described 
as “about a pint” of bright red blood."

ordered?"
15605,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The lack of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, and the pres -
ence of bright red blood per rectum are pivotal points in this case 
and make a lower GI source most likely."
15606,"Cramping is often seen 
with GI bleeds, caused by blood passing through the bowel."
15607,"The 
patient’s age, acuity, and volume of blood makes bleeding from 
diverticuli, colitis, malignancy, or angiodysplasia the most likely 
diagnoses."
15608,"Whether he has had a recent change in bowel habits, 
weight loss, or previous bloody stools is unknown; all these factors 
would heighten suspicion for colitis or malignancy."
15609,"The amount of 
blood loss and symptomatic dizziness make hemorrhoids or fissures 
unlikely."
15610,Upper sources of bleeding must also be considered.
15611,"A 
brisk bleed from an upper source can present with bright red blood 
per rectum."

15638,"The risk of diverticular hemorrhage in a patient with 
diverticuli is not known but is estimated to be 3–15%."

rule, but recurrence is common."
15649,1.
15650,"About 75% of patients experience spontaneous cessation 
of hemorrhage."
15651,2.
15652,"Nearly all patients require < 4 units of packed red blood

15657,"In general, lower GI bleeding carries a better overall 
prognosis than upper GI bleeding with about half the 
mortality rate."
15658,2.
15659,"Mortality rates for diverticular hemorrhage are higher 
(11% at 1 year and 20% at 4 years) although the cause 
of death is rarely related to the GI hemorrhage."

A."
15662,"History and physical exam
1."
15663,"The first step in making the diagnosis of any GI bleed 
is to determine whether the source of the bleeding is the 
upper or lower tract."
15664,"Other than frank hematemesis, only a 
few features are strongly predictive in localizing the site of 
bleeding to the upper or lower tract."
15665,"These are outlined in 
Table 19-2.a."
15666,"Patients who are volume depleted, orthostatic, or 
hypotensive are about twice as likely to have an upper 
GI bleed than a lower GI bleed."
15667,b.
15668,"Because urea is produced as blood is processed 
throughout the GI tract, a BUN/creatinine ratio 
> 30 suggests an upper GI source (sensitivity, 39%; 
specificity, 94%; LR+, 7.5; LR−, 0.64 )
c. Although hematochezia generally suggests a lower 
GI source of bleeding, 10–15% of patients with 
hematochezia have an upper GI source."
15669,"These 
patients are more likely to be older and to have 
duodenal ulcers."
15670,"10–15% of patients with hematochezia have an 
upper GI source of bleeding."

15672,"Beyond differentiating between upper and lower sources 
of GI bleeding, certain historical features may point to a

red blood."
15731,Initial laboratory tests are normal.
15732,"Important values are 
BUN, 12 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.1 mg/dL; Hb, 13.9 g/dL."
15733,"The 
patient was admitted to the medical ICU."
15734,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, diverticular bleed?"
15735,Have you ruled out the active alternatives?
15736,"Do other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"
15737,"Mr. T weighs 75 kg and his orthostasis suggests 20% volume deple -
tion."
15738,"His fluid deficit is about 9 L (75 kg × 20% volume depletion 
× 60%)."
15739,"Assuming this deficit is all from the GI bleed, it is very 
likely that his Hb will fall once he is hydrated."
15740,"His hematochezia and normal BUN/creatinine ratio are sug -
gestive of a lower GI bleed."
15741,"Although Mr. T is relatively young 
and does not have any comorbidities, he was admitted to the 
ICU because he has signs of hemodynamic instability, includ -
ing orthostasis with tachycardia, and has shown evidence of 
active bleeding."
15742,"Hemodynamic instability and active bleeding 
each independently are associated with tripling the risk of poor 
outcomes, such as rebleeding and mortality."

15745,"It is seen almost exclusively in older adults and 
can present with anything from hematochezia to occult blood loss."
15746,"In general, hemorrhage from angiodysplasia tends to be less brisk 
than bleeding from diverticula."
15747,"Disease Highlights
A. Angiodysplasias, also called arteriovenous malformations, are 
dilated submucosal veins that are most commonly seen in the

PATIENT 3
Ms. S is a 35-year-old woman who comes to the out -
patient clinic for an initial visit."
15953,"She is well and is without 
complaints."
15954,"On review of systems, she notes that she 
occasionally passes bright red blood per rectum."
15955,"This has 
happened about 4 times over the past 5 years."
15956,"It is never 
associated with pain."
15957,"She sometimes sees the blood on the 
toilet paper and sometimes in the bowl."
15958,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
15959,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
15960,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Ms. S has recurrent, lower GI bleeding that has occurred inter -
mittently over a number of years without obvious negative health 
effects."
15961,"This type of bleeding can be categorized as benign sounding 
anorectal bleeding."
15962,"It is bleeding in a young patient without “red 
flags” for serious disease such as anemia, change in bowel habits, weight loss, or diarrhea."
15963,"Between 10% and 20% of the popula -
tion will have this type of bleeding."
15964,"The goal is to diagnose these 
patients appropriately without missing occasional serious lesions 
and without subjecting excessive numbers of patients to unpleasant 
evaluation."
15965,"The pivotal points, in this case, are the patient’s young 
age, the small volume of blood loss, and the absence of “red flags.”
The differential diagnosis includes hemorrhoidal bleeding and 
bleeding from anal fissures."
15966,"Anal fissures are usually painful so hem -
orrhoids are the more likely diagnosis in this case."
15967,"IBD, especially 
ulcerative colitis, could cause similar symptoms, but the intermit -
tent nature of symptoms and characterization of the bleeding, (rare 
and small volume) make IBD less likely."
15968,"We need to know more 
about the patient’s bowel habits."
15969,"Diverticula and colonic angiodys -
plasia could account for the patient’s symptoms but would be very 
unusual in a patient this age."
15970,"Colon or rectal cancer is also rare 
in this age group but should be considered."
15971,"Table 19-7 lists the 
differential diagnosis."
15972,"3
On further history, Ms. S reports no recent change in 
bowel habits, no weight loss, and says she feels well."
15973,"She 
does report that although the bleeding has never been

15979,"Leading Hypothesis: Hemorrhoidal Bleeding
T extbook Presentation
Hemorrhoidal bleeding typically presents with rectal pain and 
bleeding."
15980,"The pain is worst with bowel movements, straining, 
or sitting."
15981,"Occasionally, hemorrhoids can present with painless 
bleeding."
15982,"Disease Highlights
A. Hemorrhoids are generally classified as external or internal."
15983,1.
15984,"External hemorrhoids
a."
15985,Occur below the dentate line.
15986,b.
15987,"Present either as painless bleeding or with engorged, 
painful, swollen perianal tissue; or with thrombosis."
15988,"Thrombosed hemorrhoids are purple, extremely painful, 
and may bleed."
15989,2.
15990,"Internal hemorrhoids
a."
15991,Occur above the dentate line.
15992,b.
15993,"Symptoms can be a feeling of internal fullness, painless 
bleeding, or prolapse."
15994,"Prolapse is usually painful and 
sometimes associated with bleeding."
15995,3.
15996,"Both internal and external hemorrhoids are most 
symptomatic when sitting, straining, and with 
constipation."
15997,4.
15998,"Bleeding occurs during defecation and commonly is seen 
on toilet paper when wiping."
15999,"A clinician should always verify a patient’s 
self-diagnosis of hemorrhoids."
16000,"Many patients 
refer to all perianal symptoms as hemorrhoids.Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is diagnosed by direct observation."
16001,1.
16002,"This may be accomplished visually in patients with external 
hemorrhoids."
16003,2.
16004,"Patients with internal hemorrhoids require anoscopy to see 
hemorrhoids."
16005,B.
16006,"An important question is “When does benign sounding 
anorectal bleeding need a more extensive evaluation than 
an anal exam with or without anoscopy?”
1."
16007,"One study looked at 201 patients whose review of 
symptoms revealed rectal bleeding."
16008,a.
16009,"24% of these patients were found to have serious 
disease."
16010,"The diseases were polyps (13%), colon cancer 
(6.5%), and IBD (4%)."
16011,b.
16012,"Factors associated with risk of serious disease were age, 
short duration of bleeding, and blood mixed with stool."
16013,"c. No cancers were found in patients younger than 50.
d. 6 of the 37 patients who had a clear source of anorectal 
bleeding (fissures or hemorrhoids) also had polyps or 
cancer."
16014,2.
16015,"Another study found only 10 polyps among 314 patients 
under 40 with rectal bleeding compared with 27 polyps 
and 1 case of cancer among 256 patients between the ages 
of 40 and 50."
16016,"C. In general, if a young patient (under age 40) with rectal bleed -
ing does not have a clear anorectal source or if the bleeding 
continues despite treatment of the anorectal source, a more 
complete evaluation (with colonoscopy) should be done."
16017,Patients over 40 should always be evaluated.
16018,"Although serious disease is rare among young 
people with rectal bleeding, it does occur."
16019,"Treatment
A."
16020,"Most hemorrhoids and anal fissures can be treated conserva -
tively with general recommendations for perianal well being."
16021,1.
16022,Sitz baths to relax anal sphincter.
16023,2.
16024,"Analgesia with acetaminophen, topical creams, or short-term 
topical corticosteroids."
16025,"A doughnut cushion is sometimes 
helpful for prolonged sitting."
16026,3.
16027,"Soften stool with increased fluid intake, a high-fiber diet, 
and docusate sodium or mineral oil."
16028,4.
16029,Avoid anything that may lead to constipation.
16030,5.
16031,"Avoid prolonged sitting, especially on the toilet."
16032,B.
16033,"Internal hemorrhoids that prolapse or continue to bleed 
usually require surgical removal."
16034,"C. Thrombosed, irreducible internal hemorrhoids and thrombosed 
external hemorrhoids require rapid surgical treatment."
16035,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
3
Ms. S has a normal general physical exam."
16036,"External anal 
exam and digital rectal exam are normal."
16037,"Anoscopy reveals 
1 large, nonbleeding internal hemorrhoid."
16038,A CBC is normal.

Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, hemorrhoidal 
bleeding?"
16040,"Have you ruled out the active 
alternatives?"
16041,"Do other tests need to be done 
to exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
16042,The patient has an internal hemorrhoid on exam.
16043,"This is almost 
certainly, but not definitely, the cause of her bleeding."
16044,"Because she 
is currently asymptomatic, it would be reasonable to postpone fur -
ther work-up for now."
16045,"Alternative Diagnosis: Anal Fissures
T extbook Presentation
Patients typically have severe rectal pain with bowel movements 
and bright red blood on the toilet paper."
16046,"On physical exam, a 
fissure can be found at the midline, posterior to the anal opening."
16047,"Disease Highlights
A. Anal fissures occur secondary to trauma to the mucosa of the 
anal canal, most commonly by hard stool."
16048,B.
16049,"Fissures usually present as acute onset, painful defecation, 
usually with bleeding."
16050,C. Fissures can become chronic.
16051,1.
16052,"Pain causes anal sphincter spasm that, in turn, causes 
recurrent trauma."
16053,2.
16054,"Chronic fissures can be associated with sentinel piles 
(essentially a thickening of the skin at the end of a fissure)."
16055,D. Fissures are present at the midline.
16056,1.
16057,"Fissures are usually posterior in men and can be posterior 
or anterior in women."
16058,2.
16059,"Other diagnoses, such as Crohn disease or sexually 
transmitted diseases, should be considered when fissures are 
lateral to the anal opening."
16060,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
16061,Fissures are diagnosed by direct observation.
16062,B.
16063,"Physical exam is sometimes difficult since patients are often in 
pain."
16064,"Treatment
A."
16065,"In most cases, general supportive recommendations outlined 
above for the treatment of hemorrhoids will bring relief of 
symptoms in days to weeks."
16066,B.
16067,"More chronic fissures often need therapy to relax the anal 
sphincter."
16068,1.
16069,Topical nitrates and injected botulinum toxin are effective.
16070,2.
16071,"Surgical sphincterotomy is almost always effective but 
carries a small risk of permanent fecal incontinence."
16072,"CASE RESOLUTION
3
One year later Ms. S returns to the clinic with recurrent 
bleeding."
16073,"Anoscopy revealed a bleeding internal hemor -
rhoid."
16074,"Symptoms resolve with supportive care, but bleeding 
recurs 1 month later."
16075,Colonoscopy is performed and reveals only internal hemorrhoids.
16076,"The patient declines definitive 
therapy and continues to experience rare episodes of hem -
orrhoidal bleeding."
16077,The patient’s history of recurrent bleeding is quite common.
16078,"Many 
patients with hemorrhoids will have occasional flares."
16079,"The decision 
to perform colonoscopy was a difficult one."
16080,"Although her young 
age and presence of an abnormality on anoscopy makes serious 
disease unlikely, evaluation of any patient with recurrent rectal 
bleeding is appropriate."
16081,"REVIEW OF OTHER IMPORTANT DISEASES
Occult GI Bleeding
T extbook Presentation
Occult GI bleeding presents in 1 of 2 ways: either in a patient with 
newly discovered iron deficiency anemia or in a patient with posi -
tive fecal occult blood tests."
16082,"Disease Highlights
A."
16083,"Generally a disease of older patients; average age in most 
studies is the early 60s."
16084,B.
16085,"Upper GI lesions cause occult GI bleeding slightly more 
common  than lower GI lesions."
16086,"C. The common causes of upper and lower GI bleeding account 
for most causes of occult GI bleeding."
16087,"D. Long-term aspirin, NSAID, or alcohol use is found in about 
40% of patients with an upper GI tract lesion."
16088,"E. About 5% of patients have lesions of both the upper and 
lower GI tract."
16089,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
16090,"All patients with occult GI bleeding need evaluation of the 
GI tract."
16091,B.
16092,"All patients with iron deficiency anemia need to have the cause 
of the iron deficiency identified (see Chapter 6, Anemia)."
16093,1.
16094,Iron deficiency is usually due to chronic blood loss.
16095,"Rarely, 
it is due to poor iron intake or iron malabsorption."
16096,2.
16097,Menstrual and GI blood loss are the most common sources.
16098,3.
16099,"All men, all women without menorrhagia, and all women 
over 50 (even those with menorrhagia) need to have an 
evaluation of the GI tract."
16100,4.
16101,"Women under age 40 with menorrhagia do not necessarily 
need further GI evaluation unless they have GI symptoms 
or a family history of early colon cancer."
16102,5.
16103,"Women between 40 and 50 years of age with menorrhagia 
need to be managed carefully."
16104,"They should be asked about 
minimal GI symptoms (celiac disease causes iron deficiency 
through malabsorption and the symptoms can be easily 
attributed to irritable bowel syndrome)."
16105,"There should be a 
low threshold for recommending colonoscopy in this subset 
of patients."
16106,"Always determine the source of blood loss in 
occult GI bleeding and iron deficiency anemia."
16107,"C. Evaluation of the GI tract in patients with occult GI bleeding 
should be done as follows:

1."
16108,"Colonoscopy alone is sufficient in patients with only a 
positive fecal occult blood test and no iron deficiency."
16109,2.
16110,"Evaluation of entire GI tract is recommended by most 
experts for those patients with iron deficiency anemia or iron 
deficiency anemia and positive fecal occult blood testing."
16111,3.
16112,"Video capsule endoscopy should be used in patients in 
whom EGD and colonoscopy are inconclusive."

T extbook Presentation
Patients with small bowel bleeding may present with either occult 
or overt bleeding."

small bowel imaging or endoscopy after negative evaluation of the 
colon and upper GI tract."
16115,"Disease Highlights
A."
16116,"5–10% of patients with GI bleeding have a negative evaluation 
of the upper and lower GI tract."
16117,1.
16118,"With current endoscopic and radiologic techniques, 
approximately 75% of these patients will be found to have 
a small bowel source of bleeding."
16119,2.
16120,"The remainder of cases have lesions of the upper or lower 
GI tract missed on initial EGD and colonoscopy."
16121,B.
16122,"Sources of bleeding
1."
16123,"Angiodysplasia is the most common source of bleeding in 
the small bowel."
16124,2.
16125,"Crohn disease, Dieulafoy lesions, malignancy (accounting 
for about 10% of small bowel bleeding), and Meckel 
diverticula are other common causes."
16126,"C. Obscure GI bleeding, which used to refer to GI bleeding 
with negative upper and lower endoscopy, now only refers to 
GI bleeding with normal upper and lower endoscopy as well 
as small bowel evaluation by advanced endoscopic or radio -
graphic procedures."
16127,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
16128,"A directed history may provide clues to the source of small 
bowel or obscure GI bleeding."
16129,"Ask about the use of medications 
that can cause mucosal damage (eg, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates) 
as well as a history of diseases that predispose patients to 
GI bleeding (HIV, neurofibromatosis)."
16130,"B. Repeat endoscopy, looking for lesions that were missed on the 
initial evaluation, is often the initial step in the diagnosis."
16131,"C. If repeated upper and lower endoscopies are negative, or if there 
is a high clinical suspicion for a small lesion, enteroscopy and 
video capsule endoscopy are used to image the small bowel."
16132,"D. There are multiple types of enteroscopy, including
1."
16133,"Push enteroscopy, in which a long endoscope (often a 
colonoscope) is passed orally."
16134,a. Visualization of 40–60 cm of jejunum is common.

16137,2.
16138,"Deep small bowel enteroscopy (double balloon enteroscopy, 
single balloon enteroscopy, and spiral enteroscopy) can 
achieve visualization of the entire small bowel."

16248,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
16249,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Headache is one of the most common physical complaints."
16250,"Because < 1% of all headaches are life-threatening, the challenge is 
to reassure and appropriately treat patients with benign headaches 
while finding the rare, life-threatening headache without excessive 
evaluation."
16251,Headaches are classified as primary or secondary.
16252,"Primary head -
aches are syndromes unto themselves rather than signs of other 
diseases."
16253,"Although potentially disabling, they are reliably not 
life-threatening."
16254,"Secondary headaches are symptoms of other ill -
nesses."
16255,"Unlike primary headaches, secondary headaches are poten -
tially dangerous."
16256,"The distinction between primary and secondary headaches is 
useful diagnostically."
16257,"Primary headaches, such as tension head -
aches, are diagnosed clinically, sometimes using diagnostic criteria 
(the most commonly used are published by the International 
Headache Society, IHS)."
16258,"T raditional diagnostic studies (laboratory 
studies, radiology, pathology) cannot verify the diagnosis."
16259,"Second -
ary headaches, such as headaches caused by central nervous system 
(CNS) tumors, often can be definitively diagnosed by identifying 
the underlying disease of which the headache is a symptom."
16260,"Clinically, primary and secondary headaches can be difficult to 
distinguish."
16261,"The single most important question when developing 
a differential diagnosis for a headache is, “Is this headache new 
or old?” Chronic headaches tend to be primary, while new-onset 
headaches are more likely to be secondary."
16262,"This is the first and most 
important pivotal point in diagnosing headaches."
16263,"This distinction 
is not perfect."
16264,"There are some chronic headaches that are second -
ary headaches (headaches caused by cervical degenerative joint 
disease for example) and even classic, primary headaches (such as 
migraines) can present as a new headache."
16265,"The differentiation of 
old versus new also depends on how rapidly a patient brings his 
or her symptoms to medical attention."
16266,"This being said, the classi -
fication of headaches as primary versus secondary and new versus 
old provides not only a memorable framework for the differential 
diagnosis but also a clinically useful structure by which the differ -
ential can be organized by pivotal points."
16267,The differential diagnosis appears below.
16268,"Figure 20-1 shows the potential diagnoses in a more 
algorithmic form as they are often considered clinically."
16269,"The IHS’s 
classification website (https://www.ichd-3.org/) is also a terrific 
resource for an annotated differential diagnosis."

ing, meaning that her headaches are most likely a primary head -
ache syndrome."
16303,"In a young healthy person with chronic headaches, 
migraine, tension, and cluster headaches are most likely."
16304,"Given the 
severity of the headaches, migraines are more likely than tension 
headaches."
16305,"Given the severe, throbbing nature of the headaches, a 
vascular cause should at least be considered."
16306,"An intracranial aneu -
rysm could cause similar symptoms, but the chronicity makes this 
less likely."
16307,"Table 20-1 ranks the differential diagnosis considering 
the demographic information, risk factors, symptoms and signs

quiet room."
16319,"Disease Highlights
A."
16320,"The description of migraine headaches adopted by the IHS is, 
“Recurring headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 
4–72 hours."
16321,"Typical characteristics of headache are unilateral 
location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggra -
vation by routine physical activity and association with nau -
sea, and/or photophobia and phonophobia.”
B. Migraine headaches are a chronic headache syndrome caused 
by a neurovascular disorder."
16322,"Neural events lead to intracranial 
vasodilatation."
16323,"C. They may begin at any age but most commonly begin during 
adolescence."
16324,"D. They are more common (2–3 times) and more severe in 
women than men."
16325,E. Auras can accompany migraines.
16326,1.
16327,About one-third of patients with migraines have auras.
16328,2.
16329,"Auras are usually visual, precede the headache, and last for 
about 20 minutes."
16330,3.
16331,"Descriptions of auras
a."
16332,"Frequently, patients initially describe a blind spot that 
is later accompanied by “scintillating scotoma” (flashing 
lights, spots of light, zigzag lines, or squiggles)."
16333,b. Auras usually involve 1 portion of the visual field.
16334,"c. Common qualities of auras and their frequencies are 
listed in Table 20-2."
16335,"Stern_ch20_p351-p370.indd   353 24/07/19   11:55 am354 / CHAPTER 20
Migraine auras are stereotypical."
16336,"Listening 
closely to patients with migraines describe their 
aura will make it easy to recognize auras in 
other patients."
16337,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Migraine headaches are among the most severe of all the 
recurrent headache syndromes."
16338,"(Cluster headache is the other 
primary headache that causes severe pain.)"
16339,1.
16340,"They should be considered in any patient with headaches 
severe enough to be the chief concern at a doctor visit."
16341,2.
16342,"Of initial visits for headaches in the primary care setting, 
90% meet criteria for migraines."
16343,"The diagnosis of migraine headache should be 
seriously considered in any patient who has 
recurrent headaches that cause disability."
16344,B.
16345,"As with other primary headaches, diagnosis is guided by the 
IHS’s diagnostic criteria rather than by diagnostic tests."
16346,"C. The criteria for migraines are divided into migraines with and 
without aura."
16347,1.
16348,"Migraine without aura
a."
16349,"A patient must have at least 5 attacks that last 4–72

(1) Unilateral pain
(2) Pulsating pain
(3) Moderate to severe pain intensity
(4) Aggravated by (or cause avoidance of) routine

(2) Each individual aura symptom lasts 5-60 minutes
(3) At least one unilateral aura symptom
(4) An aura that is accompanied by a headache that

D. It is important to remember that diagnostic criteria, although 
helpful, need to be used carefully when applied to an individ -
ual patient."
16358,"A patient who clearly has the disease in question 
may not perfectly fit the criteria."
16359,"Consider these data about 
some of classic migraine symptoms:
1."
16360,"50% of patients with migraines have nonpulsatile 
headaches."
16361,2.
16362,40% have bilateral headaches.
16363,"Diagnostic criteria are more helpful for 
research than patient care."
16364,"They should be used 
cautiously with individual patients."
16365,E. There are other less common types of migraine.
16366,1.
16367,"These include headaches with aura lasting > 60 minutes 
and migraine aura without a headache."
16368,2.
16369,"These syndromes are difficult to diagnose and require 
exclusion of other diseases (such as cerebrovascular 
accident, transient ischemic attack, or retinal detachment) 
that could cause similar symptoms."
16370,"F. Besides the diagnostic criteria, there are many other aspects of 
the history that are suggestive of migraine headaches."
16371,1.
16372,"A systematic review suggested the mnemonic POUNDing 
as a diagnostic test for migraines."

16383,"Another review provided test characteristics for various 
headache qualities in distinguishing migraines from tension 
headaches."
16384,"Table 20-3 shows those characteristics that have 
at least a moderate effect on posttest probability."
16385,4.
16386,"When differentiating migraines from tension headaches, 
nausea is an important clue to migraines."
16387,5.
16388,"Interestingly, some commonly considered characteristics, 
such as headache duration and relationship of headache to 
stress, weather, menses, fatigue, and odors, were not helpful 
in differentiating migraines from tension headaches."

16427,"They 
are pulsatile, unilateral, disabling, and associated with nausea, thus 
fulfilling 4 of the POUNDing criteria."
16428,"The history of motion sick -
ness provides another clue."
16429,"The increasing frequency and severity

16431,Have you ruled out the active alternatives?
16432,"Do other tests need to be done to exclude the

T extbook Presentation
Tension headaches are the most common type of headache."
16434,"They 
generally occur a few times each month and are described as 
bilateral and squeezing."
16435,"They are usually relieved with over-the-
counter analgesics and are seldom severe enough to cause real 
disability."
16436,"Disease Highlights
A."
16437,"The IHS definition of episodic tension-type headache is, 
“Recurrent episodes of H/A lasting minutes to days."
16438,"The pain 
is typically pressing/tightening in quality, of mild or moderate 
intensity, bilateral in location and does not worsen with rou -
tine physical activity."
16439,"Nausea is absent, but photophobia or 
phonophobia may be present.”
B."
16440,"Most common type of headache; the 1-year prevalence of ten -
sion headaches is 63% in men and 86% in women."
16441,"C. The IHS criteria divide tension headaches into multiple sub -
types: frequent or infrequent episodic, chronic, with or with -
out associated tenderness of pericranial muscles."
16442,"D. The pathophysiology of tension headaches is still a topic of 
debate; episodic tension headaches are likely related to ten -
derness and spasm in the pericranial muscles while chronic 
tension headaches are related to changes in the CNS and pain 
pathways caused by the chronic pain of tension headaches."
16443,E. Tension headaches can be troublesome but are seldom disabling.
16444,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
16445,"Because tension headaches are the most common form of 
headaches, they are the default diagnosis in almost every 
patient with a mild to moderate headache syndrome."
16446,B.
16447,"A detailed history and physical exam is required to exclude 
other headache syndromes that require specific treatment."
16448,C. Special attention should be given to excluding migraines.
16449,"D. The IHS diagnostic criteria for infrequent or frequent episodic 
tension headaches are:
1."
16450,"At least 10 previous headaches (fewer than 2 per month is 
infrequent, 2–14 per month is frequent)
2."
16451,"Duration of 30 minutes to 7 days
3."
16452,"2 of the following characteristics must be present:
a."
16453,"Pressing or tightening (nonpulsating) quality
b."
16454,"Mild to moderate in severity (inhibits but does not 
prevent activity)
c. Bilateral
d. Not aggravated by routine activity4."
16455,"No nausea or vomiting
5."
16456,"Photophobia or phonophobia may be present, but 
not both
E. Chronic tension-type headaches often develop from the more 
common episodic headaches."
16457,"These are similar in quality but 
occur at least 15 days of the month."
16458,1.
16459,"Chronic tension-type headaches are commonly referred to 
chronic daily headaches."
16460,2.
16461,"Chronic tension-type headaches may often be caused by 
overuse of analgesic drugs used to treat headaches."
16462,"Treatment
A. Episodic tension headaches
1."
16463,Usually treated by patients without the input of a physician.
16464,2.
16465,"Simple analgesics (acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) are the basis of most 
treatment."
16466,3.
16467,"For more severe headaches, combinations of medications 
that include caffeine can be used."
16468,4.
16469,"In patients with frequent, but still episodic tension headaches, 
efforts at stress reduction including biofeedback are helpful."
16470,B.
16471,"Chronic tension headaches
1."
16472,"These are often quite difficult to treat especially if they have 
been caused by medication overuse."
16473,2.
16474,"When treating chronic tension headaches, an important 
intervention is “detoxification,” taking the patient off their 
long-term pain medication regimen."
16475,a.
16476,"Long-term use of many headache medications has the 
potential to cause or exacerbate chronic tension headaches."

occurring around the eye or temporal region and is associated with 
ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, or 
rhinorrhea."

PATIENT  2
Mrs. L is a 65-year-old woman who comes to an outpa -
tient clinic complaining of headaches."
16560,"She reports waking 
up almost every morning with a moderate to severe, bitem -
poral headache."
16561,"She reports never having headaches of any 
consequence in the past but has been quite troubled for the 
last 2 months."
16562,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is there a 
must not miss diagnosis?"
16563,"Given this differential 
diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?"
16564,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mrs. L ’s headaches are of concern because she is older and the head -
aches are new."
16565,"Her age and the acuity of the headaches are pivotal 
features that limit the differential diagnosis."
16566,"Both these features 
raise the likelihood that the headaches are secondary and, therefore, 
potentially dangerous."
16567,"Morning headaches are classically associated 
with brain tumors."
16568,"Edema forms around the CNS lesion while the 
patient is supine at night leading to headaches from increased intra -
cranial pressure in the morning."
16569,"Further history is needed because 
brain tumors are most likely in patients with other types of cancer."
16570,"Morning headaches are also a fairly common symptom of many 
habits, diseases, and exposures."
16571,"Headaches associated with sub -
stances or their withdrawals are a common cause of morning head -
aches."
16572,"Alcohol, caffeine, and carbon monoxide are probably the 
most common."
16573,"Morning headaches are frequently the symptoms 
of diseases that are active at night or that disturb sleep."
16574,"Nighttime 
hypoglycemia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are common 
causes of headaches in this category."
16575,"Tension headaches should 
always be in the differential of headaches and may, on occasion, 
cause morning headaches."
16576,"The presence of a new, bitemporal headache in an older patient 
should raise the possibility of temporal arteritis."
16577,"Although these 
headaches are not classically morning headaches, they should still 
be considered."
16578,"Temporal arteritis will be discussed later in the 
chapter."
16579,Table 20-5 lists the differential diagnosis.
16580,"Even more than with most headaches, a careful 
history is necessary in a patient with morning 
headaches."
16581,"2
Mrs. L reports otherwise feeling well."
16582,"She says the head -
aches occur nearly every morning, irrespective of day of 
the week or whether she has slept at home or at her week -
end house."
16583,"She denies neurologic symptoms, such as focal 
numbness, weakness, or visual disturbances."
16584,"She denies 
snoring or excessive daytime somnolence."
16585,"She read on an 
Internet site that new-onset, morning headaches are clas -
sic for brain tumors and she is very nervous."
16586,"Her medical history is notable only for noninsulin-  
dependent diabetes mellitus, which has always been under 
good control."
16587,"She reports no recent change in her diet, 
weight, or medication.Medications are 325 mg/day of aspirin, 10 mg/day 
orally of atorvastatin, and 5 mg of oral glyburide taken 
twice daily."
16588,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make  
a diagnosis?"
16589,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
16590,"Many patients seeking care for a headache 
believe they have a brain tumor."
16591,"It is important 
to recognize this—a little definitive reassurance 
can go a long way."

both rapid diagnosis and treatment."
16634,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
2
Mrs. L’s physical exam, including a detailed neurologic exam, 
is normal."
16635,"Laboratory tests done on the day of the visit 
revealed a normal CBC, normal chem-7, and a glycosylated 
Hb of 5.9% (down from 7% 3 months earlier)."
16636,"A noncon -
trast head CT done on the day of the visit was normal."
16637,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, intracranial 
neoplasms?"
16638,"Have you ruled out the active 
alternatives?"
16639,"Do other tests need to be done 
to exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
16640,"Given that intracranial neoplasms are rare in patients without 
preexisting cancers and the presence of morning headaches is 
a nonspecific finding, it is unlikely that the patient has a brain 
tumor."
16641,"The noncontrast head CT was probably a reasonable test 
to do."
16642,"Although it is not as sensitive as a contrast-enhanced study, 
with the low pretest probability it effectively rules out a tumor 
and, given the patient’s concern, it was an effective method of 
reassuring her."
16643,"After the normal CT and unrevealing laboratory test results, 
attention must be turned to possible exposures or the “second -
ary morning headaches.” The patient’s marked drop in her gly -
cosylated Hb and early morning hypoglycemia are suggestive of 
a diagnosis."

Leading Hypothesis: SAH
T extbook Presentation
A middle-aged patient experiences “the worst headache of his life.” 
Soon after the headache begins, the patient vomits and develops 
neck pain and stiffness."
16757,Patients may also lose consciousness.
16758,"If the 
patient is alert at the time of medical assessment, focal neurologic 
signs and meningismus may be present on the physical exam."
16759,"Disease Highlights
A. SAH is primarily caused by rupture of a saccular aneurysm in 
or near the circle of Willis ( ∼ 85%)."
16760,B. Aneurysms are present in about 7% of the population.
16761,C. Large aneurysms (> 1 cm) rupture at a rate of about 0.5%/year.
16762,D. The vast majority of ruptures occur in persons 40–65 years old.
16763,E. SAH carries a mortality of about 50%.
16764,"F. Sentinel headaches are atypical headaches that occur in the 
weeks preceding SAH."
16765,1.
16766,"They are thought to be caused by the expansion of, or a small 
leak from, an aneurysm prior to a more catastrophic bleed."

16779,2.
16780,"Patients can be considered free of SAH if they lack all of 
the following:
a."
16781,"Symptoms of neck pain or stiffness
b."
16782,"Age > 40 years
c. Onset during exertion
d. Thund erclap headache
e. Limited neck flexion upon exam
3."
16783,The initial diagnostic test is a noncontrast head CT.
16784,"The 
sensitivity of this test varies with the time since the onset 
of symptoms."
16785,a.
16786,"First 12 hours, 97%
b."
16787,"12–24 hours, 93%
c. Falls to as low as 80% after 2 weeks
4."
16788,"Next to angiography, CSF examination for RBCs and 
xanthochromia (the result of first oxyhemoglobin and later 
bilirubin from deteriorating RBCs) is the most accurate 
diagnostic method.a."
16789,"RBCs are seen immediately in the CSF in 100% of 
patients."
16790,"The specificity, however, can be limited by 
traumatic lumbar punctures."
16791,b.
16792,Sensitivity of RBCs begins to fall after about 24 hours.
16793,"c. Spectrophotometric detection of xanthochromia is 
100% specific for SAH."
16794,"d. Most experts suggest delaying the lumbar puncture for 
6–12 hours after the onset of a headache (if clinically 
safe) in a patient with a suspicious headache and normal 
CT scan since it takes 12–24 hours for the sensitivity to 
reach nearly 100%."
16795,"e. The sensitivity of xanthochromia remains at 100% for 
over 1 week."
16796,5.
16797,"In all patients with documented SAH, angiography is 
performed to assist in surgical planning."
16798,"Angiography 
might also be done for patients in whom the diagnosis is 
unclear even after lumbar puncture."
16799,"C. Importance of correct diagnosis
1."
16800,About 25% of patients with SAH are initially misdiagnosed.
16801,2.
16802,"Patients with less severe clinical presentations are most 
commonly misdiagnosed."
16803,3.
16804,"Patients who are initially misdiagnosed are only about half 
as likely to have a good or excellent outcome."
16805,"All patients in whom SAH is suspected should 
undergo a noncontrast head CT."

normal, a lumbar puncture should be performed 
in any patient with more than a minimal pretest 
probability."
16807,"Treatment
A."
16808,"Prevention of rebleeding
1."
16809,"The primary treatment of a SAH is to occlude the culprit

16811,"This is usually accomplished by deploying platinum coils 
via arterial catheters within the aneurysm to cause occlusion."

16844,"They should be considered when the headache starts with 
cough, sexual activity, or exercise."
16845,C. One review suggested other distinguishing features.
16846,1.
16847,"Cough headaches
a."
16848,"Either represent a primary headache syndrome or 
symptoms of an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation in 
which the cerebellar tonsils protrude out of the base of 
the skull

16851,"Sexual headaches
a."
16852,"Almost always (93%) benign

16856,"Represent either the primary headache syndrome or 
secondary headaches (causes include SAH and brain 
tumor).b."
16857,"Primary exertional headaches are generally 
indistinguishable from secondary exertional headaches."
16858,"Because exertional headaches are clinically 
indistinguishable from SAH, a patient pre -
senting with such a headache must be carefully 
evaluated to rule out the latter."
16859,"Treatment
A."
16860,"Cough headaches are effectively treated with cough suppression 
and NSAIDs."
16861,"B. Exertional headaches are treated by avoiding strenuous activity 
(especially in hot weather or at high altitudes) or by using pre -
exertion ergotamine, beta-blockers, or NSAIDs."

beta-blockers."

16870,SAH developed in none of the 71 patients studied.
16871,2.
16872,Headaches generally lasted from 8 to 72 hours.
16873,3.
16874,"51 (72%) of the patients had their headaches unrelated to 
cough, sexual activity, or exertion."
16875,4.
16876,"17% of the patients had recurrent, similar headaches."
16877,"E. In 2018, a case report was published relating a thunderclap 
headache to ingestion of the “hottest pepper in the world.”
Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Benign thunderclap headaches are diagnosed when there is a 
suspicious clinical presentation and SAH is ruled out."
16878,B.
16879,"Given the poor prognosis of SAH, CT scan and lumbar punc -
ture should be performed in all patients prior to making this 
diagnosis."

clinically indistinguishable from SAH, they can 
only be diagnosed after SAH has been ruled out."

highest risk of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accidents."
16888,"D. In young patients (< age 40) without hypertension, diseases 
such as arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm rupture, and 
drug use should be considered."

Chapter 14, Dizziness."
16896,"CASE RESOLUTION
3
Given the acute-onset during exercise, the normal neuro -
logic exam, and the lack of symptoms during the intervening 
3 days, the patient was thought to have primary exertional 
headache."
16897,"A sentinel headache, preceding a SAH, however, 
was a must not miss alternative."
16898,"Given this, the patient 
underwent lumbar puncture that revealed no RBCs and 
no xanthochromia."
16899,"He subsequently experienced a similar 
headache 2 weeks later with exercise."
16900,"He was then treated 
with preexercise propranolol with good response."
16901,This patient received the appropriate evaluation.
16902,"Although he was 
feeling well at the time of the visit, the test threshold for SAH needs 
to be very low given the severity of disease."
16903,"SAH tends to be misdi -
agnosed in patients with the mildest symptoms."
16904,"This is because the 
physician’s suspicion is lowest in these patients and because the CT 
scan may be less sensitive in people with presumably small hemor -
rhages."
16905,"Accurate diagnosis of these patients is highly desirable since 
they potentially have the best outcomes."
16906,"With a normal CT scan and lumbar puncture, the diagnosis 
becomes either benign thunderclap headache or benign exertional 
headache."
16907,"The difference is likely semantic, but the headache’s 
onset and recurrence during exercise makes benign exertional 
headache the diagnosis."
16908,"Intracerebral bleed from an arteriovenous 
malformation was a possibility but was ruled out with the normal 
CT scan."
16909,"CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  4
Mrs. T is an 80-year-old woman who comes to your office 
complaining of headaches for the past 3 months."
16910,"She 
reports always having had mild headaches that never trou -
bled her enough to see a doctor."
16911,"This headache has been 
persistent, bilateral, band-like, and throbbing."
16912,"At her present visit, she reports no visual changes, no 
recent head trauma, and no neurologic deficits."
16913,"She does 
report fatigue and says that she has lost about 15 lbs over 
the last month."
16914,She denies jaw symptoms.
16915,"Her past medical history is notable for hypertension 
for which she takes losartan, morbid obesity, and a breast 
mass noted 2 years before."
16916,"The mass was thought to be low 
suspicion for malignancy and the patient declined work-up."
16917,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is there a 
must not miss diagnosis?"
16918,"Given this differential 
diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
This presentation is of concern because the patient is elderly, she 
has a new headache, and she has experienced weight loss."
16919,"The dif -
ferential diagnosis must take into account these pivotal points (age, 
subacute onset, and constitutional symptoms)."
16920,"The persistence 
of the headache probably excludes diagnoses such as intracere -
bral hemorrhage or infections."
16921,"As we explore the limited differ -
ential diagnosis for this patient, the patient’s sex and obesity are 
important."
16922,"Temporal arteritis and malignancy are both possible given the 
patient’s age and subacute presentation."
16923,"The throbbing nature of 
the pain and weight loss could certainly be consistent with either 
of these types of headache."
16924,"The history of a breast mass has to 
make metastatic disease a real consideration."
16925,"Subdural hematoma 
is possible, but the lack of a history of head trauma or use of anti -
coagulation medications makes this less likely."
16926,"Although a diag -
nosis of tension headaches should be given with extreme caution 
in an elderly person with new headaches, the persistent band-like 
description raises this possibility."
16927,"A new headache in a woman with 
obesity also raises the possibility of idiopathic intracranial hyper -
tension."
16928,This disease is more commonly seen in young women.
16929,Table 20-7 lists the differential diagnosis.

Physical exam was notable for vital signs of tempera -
ture, 37.1 °C; BP , 130/82 mm Hg; pulse, 72 bpm; RR,  
10 breaths per minute."
17005,"Head and neck exam revealed prom -
inence of the temporal arteries."
17006,"Cataracts limited the fun -
doscopic examination."
17007,"Heart, lung, and abdominal exams 
were normal."
17008,"Breast exam revealed a 2 × 3 cm mass in the 
left breast that was soft and freely mobile, which seemed 
unchanged from a description in the patient’s chart from  
2 years earlier."
17009,"Extremity exam was notable for bruises 
over her left elbow and shoulder from a fall."
17010,"Neurologic exam 
is fully intact."
17011,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, temporal arteritis?"
17012,Have you ruled out the active alternatives?
17013,"Do other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"
17014,"Temporal arteritis certainly remains high on the differential diagno -
sis."
17015,Her headache and physical exam are both suspicious.
17016,"Assuming 
a pretest probability of about 40% (the usual percentage of positive 
biopsies among people in whom temporal arteritis is suspected), 
the prominence of her temporal arteries (LR+, 2) increases the like -
lihood of the diagnosis to 57%."

T extbook Presentation
Subdural hematoma is usually seen in older patients with a history 
of falls and neurologic deterioration."
17018,"The classic triad of symp -
toms of chronic subdural hematoma is headache, somnolence, and 
change in mental status."
17019,"Disease Highlights
A. Subdural hematomas may be acute (within 24 hours of 
injury), subacute (1–14 days after injury), or chronic."
17020,B.
17021,"Acute and subacute subdural hematomas generally pose little 
diagnostic problem."
17022,"They usually produce evolving, focal neu -
rologic deficits."
17023,"C. Chronic subdural hematomas can present with subtle symp -
toms, weeks to months after trauma and can pose a real diag -
nostic challenge."
17024,"D. Chronic subdural hematoma is a disease seen in the elderly 
and others with cerebral atrophy."
17025,"Cerebral atrophy allows 
accommodation of a slowly expanding collection of blood in 
the subdural space."
17026,"E. Risk factors for subdural hematomas are frequent falls, alco -
holic dependence, and use of anticoagulant medications such 
as warfarin, direct-acting anticoagulants, or aspirin."

17035,"The absence of a trauma history should not be particularly 
reassuring as this history is often hard to establish."
17036,"The most common presenting symptom of 
chronic subdural hematoma is a history of falls."

Hypertension (IIH)
T extbook Presentation
Patients tend to be young women who are obese."
17042,"Headaches caused 
by IIH are severe, occur daily, and may awaken the patient from 
sleep."
17043,"These types of headaches are associated with transient visual 
disturbances."

17046,The characteristics of IIH are well described.
17047,1.
17048,"The disease tends to affect young (mean age around 30) 
women (> 90%)."
17049,2.
17050,Sufferers are overwhelmingly obese (94%).
17051,3.
17052,"Headache is the most common presenting symptom 
followed by transient vision loss and pulsatile tinnitus."
17053,"C. Papilledema is present in the overwhelming majority  
of cases."
17054,"D. IIH carries the risk of permanent visual loss and must be diag -
nosed and treated."
17055,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
17056,"The diagnosis of IIH is based on recognition of the headache 
syndrome, diagnosis of increased intracranial pressure, and 
exclusion of other causes of increased pressure."
17057,B.
17058,"To make the diagnosis of IIH, other causes of intracranial 
hypertension must be excluded, usually by MRI (done prior 
to the lumbar puncture); intracranial hypertension must be 
demonstrated on lumbar puncture (> 250 mm H2O) and 
either or both of the following must be true:
1."
17059,"The headache has developed or significantly worsened in 
temporal relation to the development of IIH, or led to its 
discovery."
17060,2.
17061,"The headache is accompanied by pulsatile tinnitus and/or 
papilledema."
17062,3.
17063,"The headache must improve after lumbar puncture (with a 
postprocedure pressure of 120–170 mm H2O) and resolve 
after treatment of IIH."
17064,"Treatment
A."
17065,"Weight loss and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which reduce 
the rate of CSF production) are the mainstay of therapy."
17066,B. Loop diuretics may be used as an adjunctive therapy.C.
17067,"Surgical procedures (CSF shunting procedures and optic nerve 
sheath fenestration) are rarely used for people with refractory 
disease."
17068,"4
Laboratory tests are done, and the patient is sent for a 
precontrast head CT to look for hemorrhage and a post -
contrast study to increase the sensitivity for parenchy -
mal lesions."
17069,"The patient’s test results follow: Hb, 9.0 g/dL 
(11.7 g/dL 1 month earlier); HCT, 28.1% (36.6% 1 month 
earlier); ESR, 125 mm/h."
17070,"The head CT was normal other 
than cerebral atrophy expected for the patient’s age."
17071,"Mrs. T was given 60 mg of prednisone daily and referred 
for a temporal artery biopsy."
17072,"This was done 3 days later 
and was diagnostic for temporal arteritis."
17073,"Her headache 
improved after 1 week of therapy."
17074,"Over the next 2 years, 
multiple attempts at weaning corticosteroids failed, and the 
patient continues to take 15 mg of prednisone."
17075,"While taking 
prednisone, a spinal compression fracture, acne, diabetes 
mellitus, and difficult-to-control hypertension develop."
17076,"CASE RESOLUTION
The elevated ESR made the diagnosis of temporal arteritis likely 
but by no means certain."
17077,"Taking the pretest probability of 57%, 
as it stood after the physical exam, an ESR > 100 mm/h raises the 
probability to 72%."

the side effects of long-term prednisone therapy without a more 
definitive diagnosis."

Headaches Associated with Head Trauma
T extbook Presentation
A common presentation of a posttraumatic headache would be a 
middle-aged person who recently suffered head trauma, usually 
without detectable cranial or neurologic injury, with a headache 
similar in quality to tension headaches."
17137,"The headaches are often 
associated with symptoms such as irritability or anxiety."
17138,"Disease Highlights
A."
17139,"Head trauma can cause serious cranial or neurologic injury 
including subdural, epidural or parenchymal hematoma, SAH, 
cerebral contusion, or depressed skull fracture."
17140,B.
17141,"More commonly, head trauma can cause new headaches or 
worsen preexisting headache syndromes."
17142,"C. T rauma-related headaches might occur after minor or major 
trauma."
17143,"The IHS has distinct criteria for what qualifies as major 
and minor trauma."
17144,"D. A headache associated with head trauma develops within 3 days 
of head injury (or becoming able to report headache after head 
trauma) and resolves after 3 months."

A."
17146,"Acute evaluation of head trauma
1."
17147,"In a patient with head trauma or a headache seemingly 
associated with head trauma, the first goal is to identify 
important and potentially treatable injury."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. Y is a 56-year-old man who has had several episodes of 
red urine in the past few days."
17263,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
hematuria?"
17264,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
17265,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Red urine is not always caused by hematuria."
17266,"A variety of medi -
cations, food dyes, and metabolites can cause heme-negative red 
urine, or pigmenturia (Table 21-1)."
17267,"Furthermore, not all dipstick 
tests positive for blood are due to hematuria."
17268,"In addition to detect -
ing heme in intact red blood cells (RBCs), urine dipsticks detect 
free hemoglobin (commonly associated with hemolytic anemia) 
and myoglobin (commonly associated with rhabdomyolysis), 
hence leading to false-positive tests for hematuria."
17269,"Whenever the urine dipstick is positive for 
blood, and the microscopic exam of the urine 
does not show RBCs, myoglobinuria and 
hemoglobinuria should be considered."
17270,T rue gross (visible) hematuria is always pathologic.
17271,"Microscopic 
(nonvisible) hematuria may be transient, spurious, or persistent."
17272,"T ransient causes of microscopic hematuria include urinary tract 
infections (UTIs) (which sometimes also cause gross hematuria) 
and strenuous exercise; hematuria due to these causes would be 
expected to resolve on repeat testing after 48 hours of treatment or 
after discontinuing exercise for 72 hours."
17273,"Spurious causes include 
urinary contamination from menstruation and sexual intercourse

microscopic hematuria or gross hematuria."
17277,"Microscopic hema -
turia is present when microscopic inspection of at least 2 prop -
erly collected urine specimens show > 3 RBCs per high-powered 
field (hpf)."
17278,"Gross hematuria is red or brown urine, sometimes 
with blood clots."
17279,"However, there is considerable overlap in 
the causes of microscopic and gross hematuria, and it may be 
more practical to first consider whether the hematuria is glom -
erular in origin."
17280,"Pivotal points that help distinguish glomerular hematuria from nonglomerular hematuria include dysmorphic 
RBCs (acanthocytes), red cell casts, new or acutely worsening 
hypertension or proteinuria, and increased creatinine."
17281,"While these 
abnormalities may also be seen in some of the interstitial and vas -
cular causes of hematuria, they will not be found when hematuria 
is caused by a renal structural abnormality or an abnormality distal 
to the kidneys."

Mr. A does not have the pivotal urinalysis findings that suggest

causes should be considered first."
17307,"The patient’s sex (male), age

not have abdominal or flank pain suggestive of renal colic, stone 
disease is common and should be considered."

17476,"One or more episodes of visible hematuria, usually 
associated with upper respiratory infection (often called 
synpharyngitic hematuria ) and sometimes accompanied 
by flank pain and low-grade fever (present in 40–50% of

like cirrhosis, celiac disease, and HIV infection, all 
of which are associated with a high frequency of IgA 
deposition."
17482,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Urine dipstick with microscopy and culture should be used 
to rule out infection, confirm the findings of hematuria, and 
evaluate for proteinuria."
17483,B.
17484,"A definitive diagnosis can only be made by renal biopsy with 
immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase studies for IgA 
deposits."
17485,1.
17486,"In the absence of proteinuria, hypertension, or decreased 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the clinical course (at least 
short-term) of patients with IgAN is generally benign and 
kidney biopsy is usually not indicated; periodic monitoring 
is recommended in these cases."
17487,2.
17488,"Proteinuria (> 500–1000 mg/day), elevated serum

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mrs. D is a 60-year-old, woman who complains of long-
standing constipation."
17652,"Initial laboratory evaluation reveals 
a normal TSH, normal electrolytes, and a calcium level of 
10.8 mg/dL (nl 8.4–10.2)."
17653,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
hypercalcemia?"
17654,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
17655,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Hypercalcemia is generally detected in 1 of 3 clinical circum -
stances: asymptomatic patients without risk factors for hypercalce -
mia; during evaluation of symptoms or findings that can be related 
to hypercalcemia, such as constipation, weakness, fatigue, depres -
sion, nephrolithiasis, or osteopenia; and in patients presenting with 
severe hypercalcemia and resulting altered mental status."
17656,"Although most cases of hypercalcemia are due to only a hand -
ful of conditions (primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia of 
malignancy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the milk-alkali 
syndrome), the complete differential diagnosis is extensive."

and whether the patient has a known malignancy."
17678,"A useful clinical 
algorithm is presented in Figure 22-1."
17679,"Before returning to the case, it is worthwhile to briefly 
review the basics of calcium metabolism."
17680,"Calcium levels are 
dictated by the actions of PTH, calcitonin, and calcitriol 
(1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D)."
17681,"PTH levels rise and fall in response to 
serum calcium levels."
17682,"High levels of PTH stimulate a rise in serum 
calcium by increasing both renal tubular calcium reabsorption and 
bone resorption."
17683,"PTH also stimulates the conversion of calcidiol 
(25-hydroxyvitamin D) to calcitriol in the kidneys."
17684,"Calcitriol leads 
to a further increase in serum calcium via increased absorption 
of calcium in the small intestine."
17685,"Phosphate metabolism is also 
controlled by PTH and calcitriol; PTH generally lowers phosphate 
levels through its effects on the kidney, while calcitriol generally 
raises phosphate levels through its effects on the intestine and 
inhibitory effects on PTH levels."
17686,"Calcitonin lowers calcium by 
suppressing calcium release from bones by inhibiting the function 
of osteoclasts."

In healthy patients with hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathy -
roidism is, by far, the most common diagnosis."
17705,"This disease is 
often asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic."
17706,"The chronicity of this patient’s hypercalcemia, as well as her relatively good health, 
are pivotal points that make this diagnosis even more likely."
17707,Hypercalcemia related to thiazide use is also possible.
17708,"Although 
thiazide diuretic-related hypercalcemia is usually caused by under -
primary hyperparathyroidism, thiazides do occasionally cause mild 
hypercalcemia in patients with no other cause."
17709,"FHH is another 
cause of chronic, usually asymptomatic, hypercalcemia."
17710,"Although 
it is usually diagnosed early in life, it can present similarly to 
primary hyperparathyroidism."
17711,"Most patients with hypercalcemia 
due to a malignancy have a known malignancy when presenting 
with hypercalcemia."
17712,"Sarcoidosis is not a common cause of hyper -
calcemia but should could be considered if another diagnosis is not 
made."

sis for this patient."

17720,"Leading Hypothesis: Primary 
Hyperparathyroidism
T extbook Presentation
Primary hyperparathyroidism usually presents with hypercalcemia 
found during routine laboratory screening."
17721,"Occasionally, it is 
detected during the evaluation of nonspecific symptoms, such as 
fatigue or constipation."
17722,"Disease Highlights
A."
17723,"Primary hyperparathyroidism most commonly presents with 
a modestly elevated calcium and few (if any) symptoms rather 
than the classic presentation of “stones, bones, groans, and 
psychiatric overtones.”
Primary hyperparathyroidism accounts for 
more than 90% of cases of hypercalcemia in 
otherwise healthy ambulatory patients."
17724,"B. Etiology of primary hyperparathyroidism
1."
17725,"85% of the cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are due 
to solitary parathyroid adenomas."
17726,2.
17727,"Parathyroid hyperplasia, multiple adenomas, and the rare 
carcinoma cause the other 15% of cases.a."
17728,Parathyroid hyperplasia can be sporadic or inherited.
17729,b.
17730,"Inherited syndromes of parathyroid hyperplasia include, 
among others, the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 
type I and IIA syndromes."
17731,"Patients with other relevant 
diagnoses such as pituitary tumors, islet cell tumors, 
medullary thyroid carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas 
should be evaluated for these syndromes."
17732,"C. Clinical manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism
1."
17733,"Nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and 
weakness are more common among patients with primary 
hyperparathyroidism."
17734,2.
17735,"Decreased bone density is common in patients with 
primary hyperparathyroidism while classic osteitis fibrosis 
cystica is exceedingly rare today."
17736,3.
17737,"Nephrolithiasis is present in 15–20% of patients with primary 
hyperparathyroidism."
17738,4.
17739,"Other symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism probably 
include increased frequency of hypertension, gout, and 
calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease."
17740,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Hypercalcemia should be confirmed before evaluating a 
patient for primary hyperparathyroidism."
17741,1.
17742,"The calcium level should be remeasured and corrected 
to account for the plasma protein binding of calcium."
17743,"The corrected calcium = Total calcium (mg/dL) + 
0.8(4-albumin [g/dL])."
17744,2.
17745,An ionized calcium level can also be measured.
17746,B.
17747,"Other effects of elevated PTH levels (hypercalciuria, 
hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphaturia) are seldom useful 
in differentiating primary hyperparathyroidism from 
hypercalcemia of malignancy—the second most common 
cause of hypercalcemia."
17748,"C. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is usually 
straightforward."
17749,1.
17750,"The diagnosis is extremely likely in an otherwise healthy 
patient with chronic hypercalcemia."
17751,2.
17752,"An elevated PTH level is confirmatory, distinguishing 
primary hyperparathyroidism from hypercalcemia of 
malignancy which has low serum PTH levels."
17753,3.
17754,"10–20% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism 
have normal PTH levels (a finding that is, in fact, 
inappropriate given the hypercalcemia)."
17755,"In these patients,  
FHH must be excluded."
17756,"(See the discussion of 
FHH below.)"
17757,4.
17758,"Of less importance to the discussion here, primary 
hyperparathyroidism can present with a normal 
calcium level."
17759,a.
17760,"This is often detected when a PTH level is sent in 
a patient with abnormal parathyroid imaging or 
osteoporosis."
17761,b.
17762,"The finding likely represents the earliest stage of 
primary hyperparathyroidism."
17763,"c. Before making the diagnosis of primary hyperparathy-
roidism with a normal calcium level, other causes of 
elevated PTH with normal calcium should be excluded."

Treatment
A."
17765,"Definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism is 
surgical parathyroidectomy."
17766,B.
17767,Who needs surgery?
17768,1.
17769,"Because of the generally benign course of primary 
hyperparathyroidism, not everyone needs surgery."
17770,2.
17771,"Recommendations from consensus panels are based on 
who is most likely to progress to symptomatic disease and 
who would benefit most from surgery."
17772,3.
17773,"Indications for surgery
a."
17774,"Symptoms of hypercalcemia
b. Serum calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal
c. Creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min
d. Nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, or hypercalciuria
e. Osteoporosis (bone density with T score < 2.5 at any 
site) or fragility fracture
f. Age < 50 years
g. Patient preference or patient inability to comply with 
long-term monitoring
C. This approach to deciding which patients undergo surgery 
appears to be effective."
17775,"A study observing 52 asymptomatic 
people for up to 10 years demonstrated the disease is usually 
not progressive."
17776,1.
17777,"38 (73%) had no progression of disease
2."
17778,"Patients who required surgery did so for the following 
reasons:
a. Hypercalcemia worsened in 2 patients
b. Hypercalciuria developed in 8 patients
c. Low bone density developed in 6 patients
D. Parathyroidectomy
1."
17779,"Parathyroidectomy is markedly effective at inducing 
normocalcemia (95–98%), improving bone density 
(100%), and improving symptoms (82%)."
17780,2.
17781,Preoperative imaging is recommended.
17782,3.
17783,"Patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy 
should have intraoperative PTH monitoring."

17789,"F. If surgery is indicated but the patient declines or is unfit for 
surgery, medical therapy is indicated."
17790,1.
17791,"Patients should be encouraged to remain active, stay well 
hydrated, and maintain moderate calcium and vitamin D 
intake in order to retain bone health and reduce the risk of 
kidney stones."
17792,2.
17793,"Thiazide diuretics and lithium carbonate, both of which 
can exacerbate hypercalcemia, should be avoided."
17794,3.
17795,Bisphosphonates are often used to maintain bone density.
17796,4.
17797,"Cinacalcet, a calcium mimetic, most commonly used to 
treat secondary hyperparathyroidism, is also indicated in 
for these patients.MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
1
Final laboratory test results for Mrs. D follow:
Calcium: 10.9 mg/dL
Ionized calcium: 6.20 mg/dL (nl 4.60–5.40)
Inorganic phosphate: 3.3 mg/dL (nl 2.5–4.4)
25-Hydroxy Vitamin D: 56 ng/mL (nl 20–50)
PTH: 166 pg/mL (nl < 60 pg/mL)
A diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was made."
17798,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, primary 
hyperparathyroidism?"
17799,"Have you ruled out the 
active alternatives?"
17800,"Do other tests need to 
be done to exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
17801,"Other than primary hyperparathyroidism, the differential diagnosis 
of hypercalcemia in a patient with an elevated PTH includes thiaz -
ide and lithium use, secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, and 
FHH."
17802,"Given the patient’s medications, normal kidney function, 
age at presentation, and lack of a family history of hypercalcemia, 
primary hyperparathyroidism is clearly the most likely diagnosis."
17803,"Thiazide diuretic use can be associated with hypercalcemia and 
may have been a contributing factor in the initial presentation."
17804,"FHH would remain a possibility if not for the markedly elevated 
PTH level."
17805,"Alternative Diagnosis: FHH
T extbook Presentation
The diagnosis of FHH is usually made in childhood during the 
evaluation of asymptomatic hypercalcemia or during screening 
called for because of a positive family history."
17806,"The condition may 
also present during adulthood as hypercalcemia with a normal to 
slightly elevated PTH."
17807,"Disease Highlights
A."
17808,"The mutation in FHH makes the calcium-sensing receptor, 
found on various tissues throughout the body, less sensitive 
to calcium."
17809,"In the parathyroid glands, this means that higher 
serum calcium levels are needed to suppress PTH release."
17810,"The 
defect leads to:
1."
17811,"Secretion of PTH inappropriate to calcium levels
2."
17812,"Renal absorption of calcium inappropriate to calcium levels
B."
17813,"Most patients with FHH are asymptomatic at the time of 
presentation."
17814,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. FHH is usually easily distinguished from primary hyperpara -
thyroidism as the former usually has mildly elevated calcium 
levels and a normal PTH level while the latter has an elevated 
PTH level."
17815,"B. Differentiation can be difficult because patients with FHH 
sometimes have a mildly elevated PTH, and patients with 
primary hyperparathyroidism often have mild hypercalcemia 
and have a normal PTH 10–20% of the time."
17816,"C. T wo important distinguishing features are:
1."
17817,"Patients with FHH usually have family members with 
FHH."
17818,"The genetic defect is inherited in an autosomal 
dominant manner."

17822,"Patients with FHH will have hypercalcemia and a normal

17823,2.
17824,"In the setting of a normal vitamin D level and normal 
calcium intake, urinary calcium < 100 mg/day and 
fractional excretion of calcium < 0.01 (fractional excretion 
of calcium = (urine calcium × serum creatinine)/(serum 
calcium × urine creatinine) suggests FHH."
17825,3.
17826,Serum magnesium is often increased in FHH.
17827,4.
17828,"Genetic testing is available when the diagnosis is difficult 
to make."
17829,"Treatment
T reatment for FHH is not necessary because the hypercalcemia is 
mild and only very rarely leads to complications."
17830,"Alternative Diagnosis: Thiazide-Induced 
Hypercalcemia
T extbook Presentation
Thiazide diuretics cause mild hypercalcemia."
17831,"This hypercalcemia is 
associated with a normal or elevated PTH 98% of the time."
17832,"Disease Highlights
A. Thiazide diuretics cause hypocalciuria."
17833,1.
17834,"Sodium depletion causes increased sodium and calcium 
retention in the proximal tubule."
17835,2.
17836,Thiazides probably also augment the renal effect of PTH.
17837,"B. Thiazide-induced hypercalcemia has traditionally thought 
to be mild and short-lived because in response to the 
hypocalciuria-induced hypercalcemia, PTH secretion is 
suppressed, normalizing calcium levels."
17838,"C. A recent study, however, suggests that hypercalcemia is discov -
ered, on average, about 5 years after initiation of therapy.Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
17839,"The diagnosis of thiazide-induced hypercalcemia depends 
on documenting hypercalcemia in a patient taking a thiazide 
diuretic."
17840,B.
17841,"Upon discontinuation of thiazide, approximately one-third of 
patients will have resolution of hypercalcemia."
17842,"C. Of the remaining two-thirds, about 80% will be found to have 
primary hyperparathyroidism."
17843,"Treatment
A patient with transient hypercalcemia after beginning a thiazide 
does not need treatment."
17844,"Those with persistent hypercalcemia 
after discontinuing therapy should be evaluated for primary 
hyperparathyroidism."
17845,"CASE RESOLUTION
1
The combination of hypercalcemia and an elevated PTH con -
firms the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism."
17846,"Based 
on the patient’s severe constipation, without another 
cause, the decision was made to treat her hyperparathy -
roidism."
17847,"On ultrasound, a 3 × 3 cm parathyroid adenoma 
was identified."
17848,"A minimally invasive parathyroidectomy 
was performed, successfully removing a 4-g adenoma."
17849,"After close monitoring of her calcium levels postoperatively 
(when hypocalcemia can occur), the patient had rapid nor -
malization of her calcium levels."
17850,"Her constipation, however, 
persisted."
17851,"In the end, the constipation was considered to 
be functional and unrelated to the hypercalcemia."
17852,"As discussed above, patient symptoms are an indication for sur -
gery."
17853,"In this case, however, since the patient’s symptoms were 
nonspecific, there was no guarantee that they were related to the 
hyperparathyroidism."

17875,"Disease Highlights
A. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a heterogeneous process."
17876,1.

This is an elderly woman with abdominal pain and marked 
hypercalcemia."
17902,"There are multiple pivotal points in this case that 
suggest a diagnosis other than the most common cause of hyper -
calcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism."
17903,"These include the degree 
of hypercalcemia and the abnormalities found on physical exam 
and laboratory studies."
17904,"The patient’s age and hepatomegaly sug -
gest hypercalcemia of malignancy."
17905,"Most patients with hypercal -
cemia of malignancy have a previously diagnosed cancer, but it 
is possible for symptoms of cancer and hypercalcemia to present 
simultaneously or for symptoms of hypercalcemia to be the pre -
senting symptoms of the malignancy."
17906,"Malignancy usually leads 
to hypercalcemia through the elaboration of PTHrP or through 
osseous metastasis."
17907,The milk-alkali syndrome should be considered.
17908,"The mod -
ern version of this syndrome is usually caused by ingestion of 
calcium carbonate in an effort to treat or prevent dyspepsia or 
osteoporosis or as a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroid -
ism."

the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in the 
United States."
17930,"D. For patients with severe, symptomatic hypercalcemia, therapy 
must be more rapidly effective than treatment of the under -

48 hours to reach full effectiveness)."
17931,1.
17932,"Saline hydration treats the hypovolemia that frequently 
accompanies hypercalcemia and decreases reabsorption

assist in achieving calciuresis."

care should be taken to institute other measures known to 
decrease serum calcium."
17939,"Calcium supplements should be 
stopped, drugs that lead to hypercalcemia (lithium, thiazides) 
should be held, hypophosphatemia should be treated and 
weight-bearing exercise should be encouraged."

kidney disease, or bone lesions)
2."
17999,"Biomarkers of malignancy such as clonal expansion of 
plasma cells or lytic bone lesions
B."
18000,"Clues to the diagnosis are the presence of normocytic anemia, 
bone pain, and elevated immunoglobulins."
18001,"C. There are a few important issues that may confuse the 
diagnosis."
18002,1.
18003,"Filtered light chains are not detected on traditional urine 
dipsticks."
18004,"A patient with light chain only myeloma may 
have normal amounts of serum protein, a normal serum 
protein electrophoresis and, apparently, no proteinuria."
18005,"The presence of a monoclonal gammopathy will be 
detected only by urine protein electrophoresis."
18006,2.
18007,"The bone lesions of plasma cell myeloma are almost 
exclusively osteolytic."
18008,"They will usually be missed on bone 
scans but are seen on radiographs."
18009,"Treatment
In all cases, treatment of the underlying malignancy is critical for 
managing hypercalcemia."
18010,"T reatment of the hypercalcemia itself 
that is due to local osteolytic metastases is the same as that for 
HHM discussed above.Alternative Diagnosis: Milk-Alkali Syndrome
T extbook Presentation
There can be many presentations of the milk-alkali syndrome."
18011,"Acute cases often present as hypercalcemia in women who use 
calcium carbonate for dyspepsia or osteoporosis."
18012,"Disease Highlights
A."
18013,"The milk-alkali syndrome is a syndrome of hypercalcemia, 
metabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury caused by the 
ingestion of calcium and an absorbable alkali."
18014,B.
18015,"The syndrome was first described as a complication of a pro -
posed ulcer therapy that included high doses of magnesium 
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, bismuth subcarbonate, and 
about 1 liter of a milk/cream mixture daily."
18016,"C. The pathogenesis likely involves hypercalcemia secondary to 
the ingestion followed by a resultant decrease in glomerular 
filtration rate."
18017,"The combination of acute kidney injury, 
hypercalcemia, hypovolemia, and alkali ingestion then 
causes the metabolic alkalosis."
18018,"D. The modern presentation of the milk-alkali syndrome 
includes a wide range of calcium values, low to normal 
phosphate levels, moderate acute kidney injury (average 
creatinine 4.2 mg/dL in a review of modern, published 
cases), and calcium carbonate as the source of calcium 
and absorbable alkali."
18019,"E. The milk-alkali syndrome is a distant third among the leading 
causes of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, after malig -
nancy and primary hyperparathyroidism."
18020,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
The diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome is based on history with 
supporting laboratory test results (hypercalcemia, metabolic alka -
losis, and normal to low PTH)."
18021,"Treatment
A. Cessation of calcium carbonate intake and hydration is usually 
sufficient treatment of milk-alkali syndrome."
18022,B.
18023,"Caution should be taken when treating patients with severe 
milk-alkali syndrome with fluid and loop diuretics."
18024,"These 
patients appear to be at particular risk for subsequent, 
transient, hypocalcemia."
18025,"C. A subset of patients, possibly those with more prolonged or 
severe disease complicated by hypovolemia, may never recover 
normal kidney function."
18026,"CASE RESOLUTION

The patient’s laboratory test results follow:
PTHrP: 3.3 pmol/L (nl 0–1.9 pmol/L)
PTH: 13 pg/mL (nl < 60 pg/mL)

Secondary & Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism
Disease Highlights
A."
18034,"Secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism occur in patients 
with CKD."
18035,B.
18036,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism is usually associated with 
hypocalcemia."
18037,"It is most commonly caused by kidney disease, 
which causes an underproduction of 1,25,dihydroxy vitamin D 
which, in turn, causes hypocalcemia and a compensatory 
increase in PTH."
18038,"Therapy for the hyperphosphatemia associ -
ated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, however, can lead 
to hypercalcemia."
18039,1.
18040,"Hyperphosphatemia develops in patients with CKD as the 
renal clearance of phosphate falls."
18041,2.
18042,"Early in the course of CKD, hypocalcemia, 
hypovitaminosis D, and hyperphosphatemia lead to 
(secondary) hyperparathyroidism."
18043,"The elevated PTH 
is adaptive, increasing calcium release from bones and 
enhancing renal phosphate excretion."
18044,3.
18045,"As CKD worsens, hyperparathyroidism becomes 
counterproductive as the kidneys no longer respond to 
PTH by excreting phosphate while phosphate continues 
to be released, with calcium, from the bones."
18046,4.
18047,"T reatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD
a. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate have been the 
traditional first-line therapy for hyperphosphatemia in 
CKD."
18048,"(1) Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are effective 
phosphate binders, decreasing the gastrointestinal 
absorption of phosphate."
18049,"(2) Calcium-based phosphate binders rarely bring 
phosphate into the normal range and may cause 
hypercalcemia."
18050,"(3) This hypercalcemia (and hyperphosphatemia) may 
be exacerbated by exogenous calcitriol, also used to 
treat secondary hyperparathyroidism."
18051,"(4) The combination of high levels of calcium and 
phosphate have deleterious cardiovascular effects."
18052,b.
18053,"Newer therapies offer alternatives for lowering 
phosphate without leading to hypercalcemia."
18054,(1) Sevelamer is a synthetic phosphate-binding polymer.
18055,"(2) The calcium mimetics cinacalcet and etelcalcetide 
target the calcium-sensing receptor in the 
parathyroid glands, lowering PTH levels."
18056,"(3) Newer vitamin D analogs may be able to lower 
PTH levels with less of a tendency to cause 
hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia."
18057,"C. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid 
hyperplasia of secondary hyperparathyroidism becomes so 
severe that PTH production becomes autonomous, causing hypercalcemia beyond that expected by calcium and calcitriol 
therapy."
18058,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
18059,"In patients with CKD, an elevated calcium level, usually in the 
setting of calcium-based phosphate binders, and an elevated 
PTH, is diagnostic of secondary hyperparathyroidism."
18060,B.
18061,"Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed when PTH reaches 
higher levels and does not respond to calcium supplementa -
tion and vitamin D.
Treatment
A."
18062,"The treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism is very com -
plicated and is predicated on treating the factors that stimulate 
PTH secretion in CKD: hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, 
and hyperphosphatemia."
18063,"B. T reatment involves phosphate binders, calcium and/or calci -
mimetics, and vitamin D analogs in an effort to control the 
levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphate."
18064,"C. If tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs and is symptomatic 
(based on hypercalcemia, bone disease, metastatic calcifica -
tions) parathyroidectomy is often required."

18119,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
hypertension?"
18120,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
18121,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
First, what is normal BP , and when is a patient hypertensive?"
18122,"The 
first step is accurately measuring the BP ."
18123,"Table 23-1 summarizes 
guidelines for obtaining valid BP measurements."
18124,"In addition to 
measurements taken during office visits, devices that measure BP 
at home are frequently used."
18125,"Patients with these devices should be 
encouraged to bring them to office visits to ensure their accuracy 
and assess proper BP measurement technique."
18126,"The 2017 American College of Cardiology–American Heart 
Association (ACC/AHA) Hypertension Guideline classifies BP as:
A."
18127,"Normal: systolic BP < 120 mm Hg and diastolic 
BP < 80 mm Hg
B. Elevated: systolic BP 120–129 mm Hg and diastolic 
BP < 80 mm Hg
C. Stage 1 hypertension: systolic BP 130– 39 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP 80–89 mm Hg
D. Stage 2 hypertension: systolic BP ≥ 140 or diastolic 
BP ≥ 90 mm Hg
Using this definition, the prevalence of hyper -
tension among adults in the United States is 
approximately 45%."

18154,Guidelines for measuring BP .
18155,"•	The patient should sit with feet on the floor and back supported for 
> 5 minutes in a quiet room before BP measurements are taken."
18156,"The 
patient should empty his/her bladder prior to measurement and 
avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 minutes before 
measurement."
18157,"•	Take at least 2 measurements spaced by 1–2 minutes and additional 
measurements if the first 2 are quite different."
18158,•	Using a bladder that is too narrow yields false high readings.
18159,"Instead 
of the standard cuff (12–13 cm long, 35 cm wide) use an appropriate 
larger cuff in patients with increased arm circumference."
18160,"•	Use the onset of the first Korotkoff sound and disappearance of 
all Korotkoff sounds to identify systolic and diastolic BP values, 
respectively."
18161,"•	Do not deflate the cuff too rapidly, otherwise individual Korotkoff 
sounds are missed and too low a value is measured; start with a 
deflation rate of 2 mm/s."
18162,"•	Measure the heart rate by palpation and watch out for arrhythmia, 
which mandates repeated BP measurements."
18163,"•	At the first visit, measure BP in both arms and take the higher 
value as the reference; measure BP at 1 minute and 5 minutes after 
standing upright if the patient has a disorder that frequently causes 
orthostatic hypotension."

Essential hypertension generally presents as the gradual onset of 
elevated BP , most often in middle-aged people with positive family 
histories, and generally without symptoms."
18186,"Coexisting diabetes or 
obesity is common."
18187,"Disease Highlights
A."
18188,"Patients who are normotensive at age 55 have > 90% lifetime 
risk of developing hypertension."
18189,B.
18190,"Across the BP range of 115/75 mm Hg to 185/115 mm Hg, 
each increment of 20 mm Hg systolic BP or 10 mm Hg dia -
stolic BP doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)."
18191,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
The evaluation of patients with hypertension focuses primarily on 
assessing other cardiovascular risk factors and assessing the presence 
or absence of target organ damage (TOD)."
18192,"Extensive testing for 
secondary causes is generally not done unless the patient has spe -
cific symptoms strongly suggestive of a specific secondary cause or 
if BP control cannot be achieved."
18193,"Therefore, there are 3 objectives 
of testing in patients with hypertension:
A."
18194,Objective 1: Assess presence or absence of TOD  (Table 23-3).

18207,1.
18208,"In the absence of any of the clinical clues listed previously, 
it is unlikely that the patient has renal artery stenosis, 
hyperaldosteronism, or pheochromocytoma."
18209,2.
18210,"Testing should focus on screening for more common 
causes or contributors to hypertension, such as kidney 
or thyroid disease, that are easily diagnosed with simple 
blood tests."
18211,"Initial testing in a patient with hypertension 
and no clinical clues should include an ECG, 
electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, calcium, TSH, 
urine albumin–creatinine ratio, fasting glucose, 
and lipid panel (total cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein [HDL], triglycerides, low-density 
lipoprotein [LDL])."

18217,"In community-dwelling adults age 65 years or older, 
a systolic BP goal of < 130 mm Hg has demonstrated 
improved survival without significant increases 
in harm."
18218,b.
18219,"In adults age 65 years or older with hypertension 
and a high burden of comorbidities and limited life-
expectancy, higher BP targets (eg, 140–150 mm Hg) 
are reasonable to maximize quality of life and minimize 
adverse events."
18220,2.
18221,The diastolic BP goal is < 80 mm Hg in all patients.
18222,3.
18223,"Lifestyle changes (Tables 23-4 and 23-5) should be 
initiated in all patients with elevated BP or any grade of 
hypertension."
18224,4.
18225,"A cardiovascular risk assessment should be performed to 
help guide subsequent treatment decisions."
18226,"Patients with a 
history of preexisting CVD, diabetes mellitus, or CKD may 
be assumed to have at least moderate cardiovascular risk."
18227,"In all other patients, or in patients where prior history is in 
doubt, a 10-year cardiovascular risk assessment should be 
performed."
18228,"a. Low-risk patients (elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension, 
10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD] 
risk < 10%, no TOD) should be given 3–6 months to 
achieve their target BP with lifestyle changes."

Mrs. X’s BP is uncontrolled."
18316,"She could have resistant hyperten -
sion, which is defined as a failure to reach a BP goal despite the 
use of 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive medications of different 
classes, ideally including a diuretic."
18317,"Alternatively, she could have 
“pseudoresistance,” meaning that her BP is uncontrolled due to 
poor BP measurement technique, poor adherence, white-coat effect, 
or an inadequate treatment regimen."
18318,"The first steps in assessing 
patients with uncontrolled BP include repeating the BP measure -
ment with a properly sized cuff (if the cuff is too small, the systolic 
BP can be elevated as much as 15 mm Hg), reviewing medication 
adherence, obtaining home BP measurements, and reviewing the 
medication regimen itself."
18319,"Mrs. X is adherent to her medications, is 
taking optimal doses of 3 medications from different classes includ -
ing a diuretic, and has consistent BP readings at home and in the 
office."
18320,"Thus, she meets the criteria for resistant hypertension."
18321,"After establishing that a patient has resistant hypertension, the next 
step is to consider the many potential causes (Table 23-8)."
18322,"Lifestyle 
factors are common contributors to resistant hypertension."
18323,"Elderly 
patients, black patients, and those with CKD tend to be particularly 
salt sensitive."
18324,"In an estimated 10% of adults with hypertension in the 
United States, the hypertension is due primarily to alcohol consump -
tion."
18325,"For every 10% increase in body weight, systolic BP increases 
by 6.5 mm Hg."
18326,"Secondary causes of hypertension are also more 
common in patients with resistant hypertension; therefore, elements 
uncovered from a careful history and physical exam suggesting one 
of these diagnoses should prompt additional testing in these patients."
18327,"The clinical clues in Mrs. X’s presentation include her vascu -
lar risk factors and vascular disease, suggesting she is at risk for 
renal artery stenosis."
18328,"In addition, she does have preexisting CKD, 
a common cause of resistant hypertension."
18329,"Her obesity is a risk 
factor for obstructive sleep apnea, which is present in 60–70% of 
patients with resistant hypertension."
18330,"Hyperaldosteronism should 
be considered, since it is found in 7–20% of patients with resis -
tant hypertension."
18331,"She has no symptoms to suggest a rare cause 
of secondary hypertension, pheochromocytoma (0.1–0.6% of 
patients)."
18332,Table 23-9 lists the differential diagnosis.
18333,"2
She never adds salt to her food and reads food labels 
carefully."
18334,"She does not drink alcohol and is afraid to use

gain to being somewhat less active due to symptomatic 
knee osteoarthritis."

she checks his BP and then runs to find you because it is 
220/112 mm Hg."
18478,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
18479,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
18480,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mr. J’s BP clearly needs to be lowered, and the primary question 
is how quickly this needs to be accomplished."
18481,"In other words, is 
this a hypertensive emergency  or hypertensive urgency ?"
18482,"These 
syndromes are defined by the degree of BP elevation and whether 
there is acute end organ damage."
18483,"A hypertensive emergency exists when there is severe BP ele -
vation and acute target organ involvement: acute neurologic syn -
dromes (encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accident, intracerebral or 
subarachnoid hemorrhage), acute aortic dissection, acute coronary 
syndrome, acute pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, severe 
preeclampsia/eclampsia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, or 
acute postoperative hypertension."
18484,"In hypertensive urgency, there is severe BP elevation with -
out any acute TOD."
18485,"The exact definition of “severe BP eleva -
tion” has not been established, but many experts use a cutoff of 
> 180/110–120 mm Hg."
18486,"Common causes of hypertensive urgency 
and emergency include medication nonadherence, abrupt cessation 
of clonidine, CKD, renovascular disease, drugs (cocaine, PCP), 
systemic lupus erythematosus, eclampsia, and postoperative state; 
Cushing disease and pheochromocytoma are less common causes."
18487,"A hypertensive emergency is defined by the 
presence of TOD, not by the degree of BP 
elevation."
18488,"To some extent, the degree of the acute TOD in patients with 
very elevated BP depends on the time course of the BP elevation."
18489,"For example, normotensive women in whom acute hypertension 
develops from eclampsia can have significant TOD at pressures of 
160/100 mm Hg, whereas patients with chronic hypertension can 
be asymptomatic at much higher pressures."
18490,"So, despite his very 
elevated BP , it is quite likely that Mr. J falls into the “hyperten -
sive urgency” rather than the “hypertensive emergency” category."
18491,"Nevertheless, hypertensive emergency is always the “must not 
miss” diagnosis in such patients (Table 23-10)."
18492,"3
Y ou tell the nurse to put Mr. J in an exam room."
18493,"On fur -
ther history, he has no shortness of breath, chest pain, 
edema, abdominal pain, feelings of confusion, vomiting, or 
focal weakness or numbness."
18494,"He generally appears well and 
is clearly happy to have a new job."

HYPONATREMIA
CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. P is a 66-year-old man who comes to the emergency 
department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate."
18713,Shortly after arrival he has a generalized seizure.
18714,"Initial labs 
reveal a serum sodium concentration of 122 mEq/L."
18715,What are the symptoms of hyponatremia?
18716,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
hyponatremia?"
18717,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
18718,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As noted in Chapter 1, the first task when evaluating patients is to 
identify their problem(s)."
18719,"Mr. P’s problems clearly include seizure, 
marked hyponatremia, and inability to urinate."
18720,"While other causes 
of seizures must be considered, the hyponatremia clearly requires 
evaluation because it is severe, potentially life-threatening, and 
likely to have caused the seizure."
18721,"Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormal -
ity in hospitalized patients and associated with an increase in 
mortality that is profoundly modified by the underlying cause 
of hyponatremia."
18722,"It is defined as a serum sodium concentration 
< 135 mEq/L and is classified as mild (130–135 mmol/L), moder -
ate (125–129 mmol/L), or profound (< 125 mmol/L)."
18723,"Symptoms of Hyponatremia
The adverse effects and manifestations of hyponatremia depend 
on its severity and rapidity of development."
18724,"Acute hyponatremia 
(defined as developing within the prior 48 h) leaves the brain 
hypertonic relative to the hypotonic serum."
18725,"This osmotic gradient 
drives water into the brain’s astrocytes, resulting in cerebral edema 
and CNS symptoms."
18726,"Acute  hyponatremia may cause seizures, brain 
damage, brainstem herniation, respiratory arrest, rhabdomyolysis 
and death."
18727,"Symptoms occur at much more modest degrees of 
hyponatremia than in patients with chronic hyponatremia."
18728,"Seizures 
can occur even at sodium levels above 120 mEq/L."
18729,"On the other 
hand, in chronic hyponatremia (most cases), CNS adaptations 
occur."
18730,"Astrocytes decrease their intracellular osmolality, decreasing 
the osmotic flux of water into the brain in turn causing less cerebral 
edema."
18731,"Therefore, symptoms tend to develop when hyponatremia 
is more severe than in patients with acute hyponatremia."
18732,"Seizures 
and herniation are much less frequent."
18733,"Typically, patients with 
chronic hyponatremia and serum sodium levels > 130 mEq/L are 
asymptomatic."
18734,"Symptoms associated with profound hyponatremia (< 125 mEq/L) include nausea (44–49%), vomiting (27–30%), 
gait disturbance (31%), headache 27%, confusion (14–30%), 
seizures (5%), and coma."
18735,"Before reviewing the differential diagnosis of hyponatremia, 
it is useful to briefly review the pathophysiology of normal water 
handling, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and then hyponatremia."
18736,ADH plays a key role in water handling.
18737,"In health, dehydration increases the serum sodium and 
osmolality and triggers ADH release."
18738,"This causes water channels 
(aquaporins) to be inserted into the luminal membrane of the col -
lecting ducts, promoting water reabsorption."
18739,"This restores normal 
osmolality and sodium concentration."
18740,"Conversely, excessive water 
ingestion lowers the serum sodium and osmolality suppressing 
ADH secretion and results in the removal of the aquaporins."
18741,"This 
prevents water reabsorption, promotes its excretion and restores 
the normal osmolality and sodium concentration."
18742,"Hyponatremia  occurs when water accumulates in excess of 
sodium due to an inability to excrete ingested water and in most 
patients, develops due to an excess of ADH."
18743,"The excessive ADH 
release causes persistent, sustained, and inappropriate water reab -
sorption, diluting the serum sodium (and also simultaneously con -
centrating the urine)."
18744,"In order to understand the states of increased 
ADH it is critical to appreciate the triggers of ADH release."
18745,"ADH 
is obviously released in response to an increase in osmolality but is 
also secreted in response to critical hypovolemia (in an attempt to 
reabsorb water and volume)."
18746,"The hypovolemia can be either real 
hypovolemia (as in hemorrhagic shock) or perceived  hypovolemia, 
such as when there is an ineffective circulating volume (eg, from 
severe heart failure [HF])."
18747,"In addition to these appropriate  causes 
of ADH release, ADH secretion may be inappropriate , causing the 
syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH)."
18748,"In SIADH, tumors 
and other diseases cause the release of ADH that is triggered by 
neither an increase in osmolality nor a decrease in the effective cir -
culating volume."
18749,"Finally, hyponatremia develops in some patients 
despite an appropriate suppression of ADH due to the rapid inges -
tion of such excessive amounts of water that they are unable to 
excrete it."
18750,This is referred to as water intoxication.
18751,"The differential diagnosis for hyponatremia is long, but the 
diagnostic approach can be easily framed in a few simple steps."
18752,"These pivotal steps include (1) a quick search for highly diagnos -
tic clues; (2) a clinical assessment of the patient’s volume status to 
limit the differential; (3) in clinically euvolemic patients, a review 
of their urine sodium to detect subtle hypovolemia, and finally, 
(4)  evaluate truly euvolemic patients for hypothyroidism and 
adrenal insufficiency prior to diagnosing SIADH."
18753,"Each of these 
steps is discussed below."
18754,"The first step recognizes that a few key clinical and laboratory 
features immediately suggest very specific diagnoses (Figure 24-1)."
18755,"Examples of these include marked hyperglycemia suggesting 
hyperglycemic-induced hyponatremia, thiazide use (suggesting 
diuretic-induced hyponatremia), recent participation in marathon I have a patient with hyponatremia."
18756,"I have a patient

18762,(suggesting possible Ecstasy use).
18763,"For many patients, the previously mentioned clues are absent and 
the second pivotal step evaluates the patient’s clinical  volume status 
in order to determine whether they are clinically hypervolemic, 
hypovolemic, or euvolemic."
18764,"This allows the differential diagnosis to 
be narrowed to that appropriate subset of diagnoses (Figure 24-2)."
18765,"Correct classification of the patient’s volume status requires a review 
of their history, physical exam findings, and laboratory results."
18766,"The 
clinical recognition of hypervolemic patients  is usually straightforward 
because hyponatremia typically develops in patients with advanced HF , cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and kidney failure when the 
disease is easily recognized."
18767,"Conversely, hypotension or orthostasis 
suggests hypovolemia."
18768,"Patients who are neither hypervolemic nor 
hypovolemic are classified as clinically  euvolemic."
18769,"The third pivotal step evaluates patients who appear clinically  
euvolemic."
18770,"Surprisingly, some patients who appear clinically 
euvolemic are, in fact, hypovolemic."
18771,"Here, the measurement of the 
urine sodium can be helpful."
18772,"Since hypovolemia promotes avid 
sodium reabsorption within the kidney, hypovolemia is usually asso -
ciated with a low urinary sodium concentration (< 20–30 mEq/L)."
18773,"On the other hand, euvolemic patients do not have a stimulus to 
reabsorb urine sodium and usually have a higher urinary sodium 
(> 20–30 mEq/L)."
18774,"Therefore, a low urine sodium in such patients 
confirms hypovolemia and an elevated urine sodium confirms 
euvolemia (Figure 24-3)."

18779,Figure 24-3.
18780,"Step 3: Evaluate clinical euvolemia to distinguish true euvolemia from subtle 
hypovolemia."
18781,"There are a few exceptions that should be kept in mind when 
interpreting the urinary sodium in patients who appear clinically 
euvolemic."
18782,"First, several hypovolemic conditions are associated with an 
increased  urinary sodium loss, which can be misleading."
18783,"Diuretics  
can force urinary sodium excretion despite hypovolemia."
18784,"Therefore, while a low urinary sodium in a patient taking diuretics still sug -
gests hypovolemia, an elevated urine sodium cannot be interpreted."
18785,"Hypoaldosteronism  impairs sodium reabsorption and causes both 
hypovolemia and increased urinary sodium losses."

urinary sodium concentrations."

18788,"Thiazide diuretics may also cause either euvolemic hyponatremia or hypovolemic
hyponatremia but are also diagnosed in the first pivotal step by asking about thiazide use."
18789,2Levels above 16.3 mcg/dL rule out adrenal insufficiency.

patients need to undergo corticotropin stimulation testing."

ment (despite euvolemia)."
18794,"Patients with water intoxication (due to 
psychogenic polydipsia, Ecstasy use, or EAH) may also have a low 
urinary sodium concentration because the massive water ingestion 
(and excretion) dilutes the excreted sodium and lowers its concen -
tration."
18795,"These will usually be identified in the first pivotal step by 
finding a maximally dilute urine (urine osmolality < 100 mOsm/L)."
18796,"The final pivotal step evaluates these truly euvolemic hypona -
tremic patients."
18797,Most such patients have SIADH.
18798,"However, before 
making this diagnosis, severe hypothyroidism and adrenal insuffi -
ciency must be ruled out (Figure 24-4)."
18799,It is important to mention a few potential pitfalls.
18800,"First, the 
urine sodium should not be measured in clinically hypervolemic  
patients."
18801,"Hypervolemia in such patients is associated with an 
ineffective circulating volume , which triggers not only ADH release 
but also promotes avid sodium reabsorption, thereby lowering

18803,"Second, a response to a saline challenge is occasionally diagnos -
tically helpful but potentially dangerous."
18804,"In hypovolemic hypona -
tremic patients, ADH secretion is triggered by the hypovolemia."
18805,"The saline challenge can restore the intravascular volume, suppress 
ADH secretion, and promote a brisk water diuresis."
18806,"This may 
cause a dangerously rapid rise in the serum sodium putting patients 
at risk for developing the osmotic demyelinization syndrome, a 
severe life-threatening complication of therapy (see below)."
18807,"On the other hand, the opposite can happen in patients with SIADH."
18808,"In 
SIADH, ADH secretion continues despite the sodium challenge."
18809,"This causes the water from the saline to be retained, whereas the 
sodium is excreted."

and his low serum osmolality confirms hypotonic hyponatremia 
ruling out pseudohyponatremia."
18850,"However, his urine osmolality 
is exceptionally low and is a pivotal clue."
18851,"Since ADH (whether 
appropriate or inappropriate) promotes water reabsorption from 
the urine, it also acts to increase the urine osmolality."
18852,"His maxi -
mally dilute urine (< 100 mOsm) suggests that ADH is actually 
suppressed and that the hyponatremia is due to a different mecha -
nism, specifically some form of water intoxication."

slow running pace."
18869,"b. Ingestion of excessive water or carbohydrate sports drinks 
can both produce EAH."
18870,"(Carbohydrate sports drinks are

18871,2.
18872,Hyponatremia should suppress ADH.
18873,"The finding that 
44% of runners with EAH did not have maximally dilute 
urine suggests that SIADH contributes to hyponatremia 
in some patients."
18874,"E. The key to understanding EAH is that it develops rapidly 
unlike most other causes of hyponatremia."
18875,1.
18876,"The rapid development causes more severe symptoms at 
lesser degrees of hyponatremia."
18877,"Falls in serum sodium of 
7–10% can produce symptoms resulting in symptomatic 
hyponatremia even in patients with sodium levels of 
125–130 mEq/L."
18878,2.
18879,"The rapid onset of hyponatremia renders the plasma 
hypotonic relative to the brain, (which still has normal 
osmolality), leading to an osmotic influx of water into 
the brain and cerebral edema."

hyponatremia is different from that of chronic hyponatremia 
(Table 24-2)."
18893,"The hyponatremia in EAH develops rapidly 
and an aggressive approach to correction and treatment is safe 
and recommended."
18894,"This contrasts with most hyponatremic

correction can cause a life-threatening complication, the 
osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS, see Table 24-3)."

Psychogenic polydipsia typically occurs in patients with a psychiat -
ric history and unexplained hyponatremia."
18961,"Patients are unaware of 
(or do not admit) to excessive water intake."
18962,"Excessive water inges -
tion and hyponatremia are also seen occasionally in patient who 
ingest excess water for medical procedures."
18963,"Disease Highlights
A."
18964,"In most other causes of hyponatremia, ADH is elevated (either 
appropriately or inappropriately), allowing water to be reab -
sorbed from the distal tubule, which concentrates  the urine."
18965,"In 
contradistinction, the increased water intake in psychogenic 
polydipsia suppresses ADH, increasing free water excretion 
and results in a dilute  urine."
18966,"B. Hyponatremia develops only when massive water ingestion 
is sufficient to overcome maximal urinary free water 
excretion and then dilutes the serum sodium, which 
usually requires > 8–10 L/day fluid intake."
18967,"(Less water 
intake can cause hyponatremia in patients with reduced 
kidney function who are unable to excrete large volumes 
of free water.)"
18968,"C. Therefore, urine osmolality is usually maximally dilute 
(≈ 40–100 mOsm/L) which is the key to diagnosis."

psychiatric patients."

students (and others) drinking excessive water as a challenge 
and, rarely, patients who drink water far in excess of what has 
been medically recommended."

18974,The water restriction test limits the patient’s access to water.
18975,"Since water excretion is normal, the patient excretes the excess 
water promptly and hyponatremia resolves rapidly."

aggravate the hyponatremia in psychogenic polydipsia and 
complicate the diagnosis."
18982,a.
18983,"Psychotic episodes may cause a transient release of ADH 
or an increased renal responsiveness to ADH."

18985,"In addition, nausea or psychiatric medications can 
induce concomitant SIADH (including selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and phenothiazines)."

than expected urine osmolality."
18987,"Stern_ch24_p405-p428.indd   411 12/07/19   1:34 pm412 / CHAPTER 24
C. The urine sodium is often low (despite euvolemia) due 
to the dilution of the sodium in the urine by the massive 
excretion of water (mean 18 mEq/L)."
18988,"This can incorrectly 
suggest hypovolemia."

A. Hyponatremia is a marker of advanced cirrhosis found in 3% 
of patients with Child-Pugh class A, 16% in those with class B, 
and 31% of those with class C.
B. Hyponatremia is associated with a higher frequency of 
adverse outcomes (including hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic 
encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and death), 
especially if there is no clear precipitant of the hyponatremia."
19056,1.
19057,"One study of hospitalized patients reported a 25% 
mortality among cirrhotic patients without hyponatremia

1."
19063,"Decreased effective circulating volume (caused by 
hypoalbuminemia, splanchnic and systemic dilatation) 
decreases mean arterial pressure, triggering the release 
of ADH which in turn causes water retention and 
hyponatremia."
19064,"Other intrarenal changes also contribute to 
the hyponatremia."
19065,2.
19066,"NSAIDs may decrease the GFR aggravating both edema 
and hyponatremia."
19067,"NSAIDs also lower renal PGE2, which 
normally antagonizes ADH."

19091,"Since the hyponatremia develops gradually, severe symptoms 
due to the hyponatremia are uncommon."
19092,"Nonetheless, 
patients with severe neurologic symptoms (coma or seizures) 
and severe hypernatremia should be treated emergently with 
hypertonic (3%) normal saline (Table 24-2)."
19093,B.
19094,"Similar to all patients with chronic hyponatremia, care must 
be taken to ensure that treatment does not cause the serum 
sodium to rise too quickly."

19115,"Water reten -
tion exceeds  sodium retention, causing the hyponatremia."
19116,1.
19117,"Free water clearance is impaired in large part secondary to 
elevated ADH levels."
19118,"This develops when the low cardiac 
output triggers carotid baroreceptors that stimulate ADH 
release increasing water reabsorption in the collecting 
tubules and thereby hyponatremia."
19119,2.
19120,"Other factors that contribute to the hyponatremia include a 
decrease in the GFR (due to decreased renal perfusion) and 
an increase in proximal sodium reabsorption."
19121,"(In order to 
excrete free water, sodium must be delivered more distally, 
where it can be pumped out of the impermeable parts of 
the tubule, leaving solute free water behind which can be 
excreted.)"

Mrs. L is a 60-year-old woman who comes to see you with a 
chief complaint of weakness and fatigue."
19193,"Her past medical 
history is remarkable only for hypertension that is treated 
with amlodipine."
19194,"Routine chemistries reveal a serum sodium 
of 123 mEq/L."
19195,"Her potassium and other electrolytes and 
creatinine are normal."
19196,"Her glucose is 108 mg/dL and BUN 
is 28 mg/dL."
19197,"Follow up labs reveal a serum osmolality is 
265 mOsm/L and urine osmolality of 470 mOsm/L."
19198,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
19199,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
19200,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Again, the first step in evaluating the patient with hyponatremia 
is to review the history, physical exam, and initial lab findings 
for highly specific clues that point to a particular diagnosis (ie, a 
history of thiazide use, recent marathon, marked hyperglycemia, 
unexplained hyperkalemia, a maximally dilute urine or normal 
serum osmolality) (see Figure 24-1)."
19201,"She is not taking a thiazide 
diuretic, and her blood glucose and potassium are normal, ruling 
out marked hyperglycemic hyponatremia and making the diagno -
sis of primary adrenal insufficiency less likely."
19202,"Her urine osmolality 
is normal ruling out some form of water intoxication."
19203,"Her serum 
creatinine is normal (ruling out kidney failure) and her serum 
osmolality is low, confirming true hypo-osmolar hyponatremia and 
ruling out pseudohyponatremia."
19204,"The second key pivotal point is to 
classify Mrs. L ’s clinical volume status as hypervolemic, euvolemic, 
or hypovolemic (see Figure 24-2)."
19205,"A careful exam should search 
for signs of hypervolemia (edema, JVD, S3 gallop, crackles, or 
ascites) or hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia, or orthostatic 
hypotension)."
19206,"3
Mrs. L denies any history that suggests volume loss 
(vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive perspiration)."
19207,"She denies 
symptoms suggestive of hypervolemia such as edema, dys -
pnea on exertion, or orthopnea."
19208,"Furthermore, she has no 
history of any of the diseases associated with hypervolemic 
states (HF , cirrhosis, kidney disease, or nephrotic syn -
drome)."
19209,"On physical exam, BP is normal with no significant 
change going from lying to standing."
19210,"There is no pretibial 
or pedal edema."
19211,"Cardiovascular exam reveals no JVD or S3 
gallop."
19212,"She has no crackles on lung exam, and there are no 
signs of ascites (bulging flanks, shifting dullness)."
19213,"Mrs. L ’s history and exam suggest neither hypervolemia nor 
hypovolemia."
19214,"Therefore, she is classified as clinically  euvolemic."
19215,"The third key pivotal step reviews her urine sodium to distin -
guish true euvolemia from subtle hypovolemia (see Figure 24-3)."
19216,"3
Mrs. L’s urine sodium concentration is 60 mEq/L.The elevated urine sodium argues against hypovolemia and is 
consistent with the clinical impression that Mrs. L is euvolemic."
19217,"The final step explores the differential diagnosis for euvolemic 
hyponatremia (see Figure 24-4)."
19218,"Causes include SIADH (most 
common), secondary adrenal insufficiency, and severe hypothyroid -
ism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] > 50 milli-international 
units/mL)."
19219,"Although other disease states can cause euvolemic 
hyponatremia (such as the water intoxication states and thiazide 
use), these are usually diagnosed initially by history or a low 
urine osmolality."
19220,At this point the leading hypothesis is SIADH.
19221,Table 24-7 lists the differential diagnosis.
19222,"Further history and labo -
ratory studies may help rank the differential diagnosis."

P ast medical history: As noted above, she has hyperten -
sion treated with amlodipine."

year history of smoking."

denies any drug use."
19227,"Review of systems is unremark -
able."
19228,"Her TSH is 2.3  milli-international units/L (normal 
< 4.0 milli-international units/L)."
19229,Mrs. L ’s history is not particularly diagnostic.

essentially rules out primary hypothyroidism."

and tobacco history raise the possibility of SIADH from a lung 
cancer."

of hyponatremia and should be considered a “must not miss”

that new equilibrium point."
19257,2.
19258,"Therefore, hyponatremia is not progressive."
19259,3.
19260,"Patients typically have serum sodium levels between 
125 mEq/L and 135 mEq/L."

19266,T reatment is directed at the underlying disorder.
19267,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
19268,"Standard criteria
1."
19269,Effective serum osmolality is low (< 275 mOsm/L).
19270,"This 
can be calculated using the following equation: Effective 
osmolality = (2 × Na+) + (Glucose/18).2."
19271,"Urine sodium is typically > 30 mEq/L in patients with 
a normal dietary intake of sodium."
19272,"(Since patients are 
typically euvolemic, there is no stimulus to avidly reabsorb 
sodium and it is excreted.)"
19273,"However, patients with a low 
dietary intake of sodium (13–42% of patients) may have 
a low urine sodium and low FENa."
19274,3.
19275,Urine osmolality is inappropriately not maximally dilute.
19276,Urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/L and usually > 300 mOsm/L.
19277,"(ADH leads to water reabsorption in the tubules, 
concentrating the urine.)"
19278,4.
19279,Patients are not using diuretics.
19280,5.
19281,Patients are clinically euvolemic.
19282,6.
19283,"Other causes of euvolemic hyponatremia must be excluded 
(hypothyroidism, psychogenic polydipsia, secondary 
adrenal insufficiency)."
19284,a.
19285,"Secondary adrenal insufficiency can cause euvolemic 
hyponatremia and mimic SIADH."
19286,b.
19287,"Despite recommendations to rule out adrenal 
insufficiency in patients with suspected SIADH, only 
33–41% of patients are appropriately evaluated for 
adrenal insufficiency."
19288,"c. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed in 3–4% 
of patients in whom SIADH is initially suspected."
19289,"(In 59% of patients, the secondary adrenal insufficiency 
was due to exogenous steroid use.)"
19290,"Treatment
A."
19291,Determine and treat underlying etiology.
19292,1. Review medications.
19293,"Discontinue any medications that 
may cause SIADH."
19294,2.
19295,Consider CT scan of the chest and head.
19296,3.
19297,"SIADH often resolves with treatment of the underlying 
disorder (eg, cancer, infection)."
19298,"When due to cancer, 
recurrent SIADH suggests cancer recurrence."
19299,B.
19300,"It is important to note that isotonic saline  without furosemide 
may worsen  hyponatremia because ADH promotes water 
retention while the sodium is excreted."
19301,"Normal saline may worsen  hyponatremia in 
patients with SIADH."
19302,"C. Therapeutic options include fluid restriction < 800 mL/day, 
salt tablets, furosemide with salt tablets, hypertonic 3% saline, 
and ADH receptor antagonists."
19303,1.
19304,"Fluid restriction < 800 mL/day is often used (except in 
patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage)."
19305,"Of note, fluid 
restriction is unlikely to be successful as the sole measure if 
urine osmolality is > 500 mOsm/L."
19306,2.
19307,"Salt tablets can increase urine osmolality and facilitate 
increased water loss."
19308,3.
19309,"Furosemide may be a useful adjunct to salt supplementation 
because it decreases the concentration of solute in the renal 
medulla (which creates the osmotic driving force for water 
retention), and thereby facilitates water excretion."
19310,4.
19311,"Hypertonic saline (3%) augments water elimination and is 
effective."

exceed recommended rates of correction (Table 24-2) 
in order to avoid subsequent ODS (Table 24-3)."
19315,"(1) Frequent sodium monitoring is critical to guide 
therapy."
19316,"Although a large number of calculations 
have been used to predict the response to therapy 
(normal saline or 3% normal saline), the kidney’s 
response to therapy renders these frequently, and 
occasionally dangerously, inaccurate."

furosemide."

As noted above, Mrs. L is clinically euvolemic with a serum 
osmolality of 265 mOsm/L, urine osmolality of 470 mOsm/L, 
and urine Na+ of 60 mEq/L."
19324,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, SIADH?"
19325,"Have 
you ruled out the other active alternatives 
that cause euvolemic hyponatremia?"
19326,"Do 
other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"
19327,Mrs. L ’s fulfills virtually all of the diagnostic criteria for SIADH.
19328,"She is hypo-osmolar, clinically euvolemic, confirmed by her ele -
vated urine sodium, with an elevated urine osmolality and has a 
normal TSH (ruling out severe hypothyroidism as an alternative 
cause)."
19329,"The only remaining criteria is to exclude adrenal insuffi -
ciency, which as noted previously, is potentially life-threatening 
disease that can mimic SIADH."
19330,"If SIADH is confirmed, a search 
for the underlying cause is appropriate."
19331,"Alternative Diagnosis: Adrenal Insufficiency
T extbook Presentation
Patients may have chronic symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, nau -
sea, vomiting, orthostasis, and abdominal pain or acute symptoms, 
such as a clinical constellation that suggests septic shock (hypoten -
sion and fever)."
19332,"Adrenal insufficiency may also cause hypoglyce -
mia."
19333,"Both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency may cause 
hyponatremia."
19334,"Disease Highlights
A. Pathophysiology
1."
19335,Adrenal insufficiency may be primary or secondary.
19336,a.
19337,"Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs when damage 
to the adrenal gland results in inadequate cortisol 
production."
19338,"Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 
increases because the hypothalamic pituitary axis 
attempts to compensate for the hypocortisolism."
19339,b.
19340,"Secondary adrenal insufficiency develops when 
damage to the hypothalamic pituitary system results in inadequate corticotropin (ACTH) production resulting 
in inadequate adrenal stimulation and hypocortisolism."
19341,2.
19342,"In both cases (primary and secondary adrenal 
insufficiency), cortisol levels are low."
19343,"Cortisol normally 
suppresses ADH release."
19344,"Decreased cortisol causes increased 
ADH levels and promotes hyponatremia."
19345,3.
19346,"Primary adrenal insufficiency
a."
19347,"The destruction of the adrenal gland often results in 
decreased synthesis of other adrenal hormones as well 
as cortisol."
19348,"Aldosterone, DHEA, and catecholamine 
synthesis may be impaired."
19349,"(1) Aldosterone deficiency results in salt losses and 
clinical hypovolemia."
19350,"The hypovolemia may further 
stimulate ADH release."
19351,"Finally, the aldosterone 
deficiency may also cause hyperkalemia."
19352,"Suspect primary  adrenal insufficiency in 
hyponatremic patients with hyperkalemia."
19353,"(2) DHEA deficiency affects women but not men 
(due to the presence of more potent testicular 
androgens)."
19354,"Findings may include decreased libido, 
decreased axillary and pubic hair, and amenorrhea."
19355,"(3) Catecholamine synthesis is also usually impaired 
(except in autoimmune adrenal disease)."
19356,b.
19357,"When secondary to autoimmune destruction 
(see below) may also be associated with other 
autoimmune diseases: hypothyroidism (47%), type 
1 diabetes (12%), vitamin B12 deficiency (10%), and 
premature ovarian failure (6.6% of women)
4."
19358,"Secondary adrenal insufficiency (hypothalamic-pituitary 
insufficiency)
a."
19359,"Decreased ACTH results in decreased cortisol levels, 
increasing ADH and causing hyponatremia."
19360,"b. Hyponatremia may be precipitated by inter-current 
illness, leading to inadequate cortisol response; 43% 
of patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency 
had superimposed infection when presenting with 
hyponatremia."
19361,"c. May be associated with deficiencies of other 
pituitary hormones (ie, luteinizing hormone [LH], 
TSH) resulting in concomitant hypogonadism or 
hypothyroidism."
19362,"d. Unlike primary adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal gland 
is not destroyed in secondary adrenal insufficiency."
19363,"Since aldosterone secretion is primarily under control 
of the renin angiotensin system, it remains unaffected."
19364,"Therefore, patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency 
are euvolemic and do not develop hyperkalemia."
19365,"B. Etiology
1."
19366,"Etiologies of primary adrenal insufficiency
a. Autoimmune adrenalitis (80–90% of cases in developed 
nations)
b. HIV infection: Up to 20% of patients with HIV have 
adrenal insufficiency."
19367,"c. T uberculosis (most common cause in developing nations)
d. Less common etiologies: Fungal or cytomegalovirus 
infections, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (seen in septic 
shock, patients taking anticoagulants, meningococcemia, 
postoperative patients, and the anticardiolipin antibody 
syndrome), infiltration (cancer), inherited disorders

and certain drugs (ketoconazole, rifampin, phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, St. John’s wort, and others)
2."
19368,"Etiologies of secondary adrenal insufficiency 
(hypothalamic-pituitary insufficiency)
a. Iatrogenic due to corticosteroid therapy
(1) Adrenal insufficiency may develop in up to 50% of 
patients taking long-term low-dose corticosteroid 
therapy (oral > 5 mg/day prednisone for > 3 months, 
inhaled, topical, or intra-articular)."
19369,"(2) Recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
may take 9–12 months."
19370,"b. Sepsis
c. Pituitary tumors (30% of patients with a pituitary 
macroadenoma exhibit adrenal insufficiency)
d. Less common etiologies: Pituitary infarction, traumatic 
brain injury, irradiation, autoimmune hypophysitis, 
HIV, sarcoidosis, hemorrhage, hemochromatosis, empty 
sella syndrome

hypotension (90%), unexplained fever (66%), 
abdominal pain (with rigidity or rebound in 22%),

also have unexplained hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, 
and hyperkalemia."

19377,"Occurs in 8% of patients with adrenal insufficiency 
per year; 6% of episodes fatal
c. Often precipitated by inter-current stress (infection, 
emotional stress, surgery, pain, and many others)
d. May be the initial manifestation of adrenal insufficiency
e. Adrenal crisis may occur despite  increase in 
glucocorticoids with stress."
19378,"f. Occurs in patients with either primary or secondary 
adrenal insufficiency
2."
19379,"Chronic adrenal insufficiency
a."
19380,"May present with a variety of nonspecific symptoms 
(eg, fatigue, weakness, weight loss, abdominal 
discomfort, musculoskeletal pains)
b. Hypotension can be seen in both primary and secondary 
adrenal insufficiency due to the loss of vascular tone 
associated with hypocortisolism."
19381,"It is more common in 
primary adrenal insufficiency (90%) due to concomitant 
aldosterone deficiency."
19382,"c. Hyperpigmentation is seen only in primary adrenal 
insufficiency."
19383,"(1) Underproduction of adrenal cortisol causes 
a compensatory increase in the release of 
proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor 
hormone that contains both ACTH and 
melanocyte-stimulating hormone."
19384,"(2) Typically develops in exposed areas such as the 
face, dorsum of hands, and knuckles, as well as the palmer creases of interphalangeal joints and 
areola of breast."
19385,"There may also be a blue-black 
hyperpigmentation of the buccal mucosa."
19386,"Patients 
often appear “tanned.”
(3) Older reports suggest hyperpigmentation was 
invariable in primary adrenal insufficiency."
19387,"A more 
recent report found hyperpigmentation in only 
18% of such patients."
19388,"d. Other findings in chronic adrenal insufficiency
(1) Weakness, tiredness, fatigue: 100%
(2) Weight loss and anorexia: 100%

19389,"(11) Women may lose pubic and axillary hair in primary 
adrenal insufficiency due to the lack of adrenal 
androgens."

19392,"Guidelines suggest corticotropin stimulation testing (CST) 
in all cases of suspected adrenal insufficiency."
19393,"However, in 
many patients, adrenal insufficiency can be ruled in or out 
with just a morning cortisol measurement, omitting the 
need for the more complex CST."

19395,"Morning cortisol levels
a. Cortisol secretion demonstrates a marked diurnal 
variation."
19396,b.

adrenal insufficiency."

H. Pathophysiology
1."
19501,"Thiazide diuretics interfere with NaCl transport in cortical 
diluting segments, causing natriuresis and interfering with 
the generation of free water within the tubule."
19502,"This limits 
free water excretion."
19503,2.
19504,The natriuresis results in hypovolemia.
19505,3.
19506,"Hypovolemia may increase ADH levels, and interfere with 
free water clearance."
19507,4.
19508,"Hypovolemia also reduces the GFR, which increases 
proximal sodium reabsorption, leading to reduced distal 
sodium delivery and reduced free water clearance."
19509,5.
19510,"In some patients, hyponatremia develops due to a 
combination of increased water intake coupled with 
ADH independent water retention."
19511,"Such patients appear 
clinically euvolemic."
19512,"I. NSAID use may increase the risk of thiazide-induced 
hyponatremia."

tremia due to marked hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, are 
usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally due to laboratory

kidney failure often present with edema and may have neurologic 
signs caused by the uremia or hyponatremia or both."
19591,"Disease Highlights
A."
19592,"Because sodium is the major extracellular osmol, hyponatremia 
is almost always associated with hypo-osmolality."
19593,B.
19594,"Occasionally, hyponatremia occurs in patients with either a 
normal  or elevated  serum osmolality."
19595,"The conditions associated

19597,"Pseudohyponatremia
a."
19598,"Marked hyperlipidemia and marked hyperproteinemia 
may interfere with the accurate measurement of sodium 
and cause the sodium concentration to appear spuriously  
low and are therefore referred to as pseudohyponatremia."
19599,b.
19600,The actual serum sodium is normal.
19601,"Stern_ch24_p405-p428.indd   423 12/07/19   1:34 pm424 / CHAPTER 24
c. The measured serum osmolality is normal."
19602,"d. These conditions should be suspected in patients with 
hyponatremia but normal serum osmolality."
19603,2.
19604,"Marked hyperglycemia
a."
19605,"In poorly controlled diabetes, marked hyperglycemia 
acts as an osmotic agent and draws water into the 
extracellular space and thereby dilutes the sodium 
causing true hyponatremia."
19606,"In this situation, the 
hyperglycemia makes the serum hyperosmolar."
19607,b.
19608,"The elevated serum osmolality stimulates ADH 
release (decreasing free water clearance) which further 
accentuates the hyponatremia."
19609,"(Hypernatremia may 
also occur if water intake is limited."
19610,See below.)
19611,3.
19612,"Uremia:
a. Kidney failure often interferes with free water clearance, 
causing water retention and true hyponatremia."
19613,b.
19614,"However, the kidney failure also interferes with urea 
clearance and marked elevations in urea can occur 
increasing both the measured and calculated serum 
osmolality resulting in both true hyponatremia and an 
elevated or normal serum osmolality."
19615,"c. Unlike hyperglycemia, urea crosses cell membranes 
and does not draw water into the intravascular space."
19616,"Therefore, urea itself is not the cause of hyponatremia in 
kidney failure but is rather due to water retention."
19617,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
19618,True hyponatremia always lowers the serum osmolality.
19619,"Hyponatremic patients with a normal  or elevated  serum 
osmolality have pseudohyponatremia."
19620,B.
19621,"The serum glucose, lipids, total protein, BUN, and creatinine 
should be measured."
19622,"C. The serum sodium can be measured accurately by some point 
of care devices and blood gas analyzers."
19623,"D. Marked hyperglycemia and an elevated serum osmolality 
suggests pseudohyponatremia due to hyperglycemia."
19624,1.
19625,"Correction factors can help determine whether the 
hyponatremia is solely due to the hyperglycemia or some 
other cause."
19626,The optimal correction factor is controversial.
19627,2.
19628,"Experiments suggest that hyperglycemia decreases the 
actual serum sodium concentration by 2.4 mEq/L for every 
100 mg/dL elevation in blood glucose."
19629,"This allows clinicians to 
estimate the serum sodium after the hyperglycemia is treated 
and the water relocates to the intracellular compartment."
19630,3.
19631,"Corrected serum sodium = measured serum sodium + 
{2.4 *(glucose – 100)/100}
4."
19632,"For example, in a patient with a measured serum sodium 
of 122 mEq/L and glucose of 1000 mg/dL, the estimated 
corrected sodium followed treatment of the hyperglycemia 
= 122 + {2.4*(1000 – 100)/100) = 122 + 21.6 ≈ 144

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 4
Mr. R is an 80-year-old nursing home resident with a 
history of severe dementia."
19666,"He has been brought to the 
emergency department with lethargy and confusion."
19667,"Serum 
chemistries reveal a sodium level of 168 mEq/L."
19668,"As noted in Chapter 1, the first task when evaluating patients is 
to identify their problem(s)."
19669,"Like hyponatremic patients, hyper -
natremic patients often suffer from an altered sensorium; hyper -
natremia is found on serum chemistries."
19670,"In addition to evaluating 
other possible causes of confusion, the cause of the hypernatremia 
should be determined and treatment initiated since the hyperna -
tremia may be contributing to the delirium."
19671,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
hypernatremia?"
19672,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
19673,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Hypernatremia (defined as serum sodium > 145 mEq/L) is almost 
always secondary to a free water deficit."
19674,"The differential diagnosis 
of hypernatremia is markedly simpler than that of hyponatremia 
and usually develops in 1 of 3 situations: (1) impaired water intake, 
(2) hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, or rarely (3) diabetes insipidus."
19675,"Hypernatremia and hyperosmolality are potent stimulators not 
only of ADH, but also of thirst, which promotes drinking and 
protects against hypernatremia."
19676,"Therefore, hypernatremia occurs 
almost exclusively in patients who are either unaware of their 
thirst or physically unable to get to water."
19677,"The most common clin -
ical scenarios involve infants or debilitated elderly patients with 
severe dementia."
19678,"In such patients, normal insensible water losses 
or increased water loss (ie, from diarrhea) are not matched by oral 
intake and hypernatremia develops."
19679,"Normal kidneys respond by 
maximizing water reabsorption resulting in a high urine osmolality 
(> 600 mOsm/L)."
19680,"In over 50% of elderly patients, a superimposed 
process (ie, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or cerebrovascular 
accident) is present."
19681,"The 30-day mortality in elderly hypernatremic 
patients has been reported at 41.5%."
19682,"Clinicians should search for an underlying 
cause in patients discovered to have 
hypernatremia."
19683,"Hypernatremia may also develop in patients with marked hyper -
glycemia."
19684,"The osmotic diuresis results in a free water loss and may 
result in hypernatremia if free water intake is impaired due to an 
altered sensorium."
19685,"The magnitude of the hypernatremia may not 
be obvious on initial laboratory results because the hyperglycemia 
draws water from the intracellular compartment into the extracel -
lular compartment diluting the sodium concentration."
19686,"With treat -
ment of the hyperglycemia, water moves back to the intracellular 
space and the hypernatremia worsens."
19687,"(See Chapter 12, Diabetes.)"
19688,"Other causes of hypernatremia are rare and will be touched 
upon here only briefly."
19689,"Hypernatremia may develop in patients with 
impaired renal water conservation  (ie, diabetes insipidus)."
19690,"Even in 
these patients, increased thirst normally prompts increased water 
intake and allows such patients to compensate and maintain normal serum sodium levels."
19691,"(These patients complain of polydipsia and 
polyuria.)"
19692,"Hypernatremia may develop when a superimposed pro -
cess limits water intake."
19693,"The urine osmolality in such patients is 
inappropriately low (< 600 mOsm/L)."
19694,"Diabetes insipidus can result 
from pituitary processes that decrease ADH production or renal 
processes, which cause resistance to ADH."
19695,"Finally, very rare causes 
of hypernatremia include hypothalamic lesions, which render 
patients unaware of thirst despite a normal sensorium, or increased 
salt intake (ie, infusion of hypertonic saline or salt water ingestion)."
19696,"In summary, the approach to hypernatremia focuses on a thor -
ough history and physical exam with particular emphasis on the 
assessment of vital signs, orthostasis, and dehydration."
19697,"A urine 
osmolality, serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and glucose 
are often adequate to determine the etiology."

due to the hypernatremia (depressed sensorium, coma, focal defi -
cits, and seizures)."

Secondary to Inadequate Water Intake
T extbook Presentation
Patients with hypernatremia due to inadequate water ingestion 
usually have an altered neurologic status or physical disability."
19739,"A 
superimposed illness may worsen cognitive function, decrease oral 
intake, and promote hypernatremia."
19740,"Mental status is almost always 
impaired and may vary from confusion to frank coma."
19741,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
The diagnosis is easily confirmed by the presence of hypernatremia, 
increased urine osmolality, and absence of hyperglycemia."
19742,"Treatment
A."
19743,"The brain adapts to hypernatremia by increasing intracellular 
osmolality to minimize cellular dehydration."
19744,B.
19745,"Rapid correction of hypernatremia makes the serum hypo -
tonic relative to the brain."
19746,"This promotes osmotic movement 
of water into the brain and cerebral edema."
19747,"Seizures and 
death can occur if correction is too rapid, although this occurs 
almost exclusively in children.C."
19748,"Hypernatremia should be corrected slowly ≅ 0.4 mEq/L/h 
(≤ 10 mEq/L/day)."
19749,"D. A recommended approach includes the following:
1."
19750,"Normal saline to correct the patient’s concomitant volume 
deficit
a. Hypernatremic patients are usually markedly 
hypovolemic."
19751,"If hypotensive, they may be 10% 
dehydrated (7L in a 70-kg man)."
19752,b.
19753,"Often patients will take several 1-liter boluses to improve 
BP , resolve orthostasis, and improve urinary output."
19754,"c. Normal saline boluses commonly administered as 
500–1000 mL over 1 hour
d. Patients should be reevaluated after each bolus."
19755,"Vital 
signs and orthostasis should be rechecked, and patients 
should have a careful heart and lung exam to ensure 
they are not receiving excessive fluid."
19756,"Urinary output 
should be monitored."

be stopped and the remaining fluid deficit divided over 
the next 48 hours."

I have a patient with hypotension."
19874,"How do I 
determine the cause?"
19875,"CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT  1
Ms. P is a 75-year-old woman with weakness and 
hypotension."
19876,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
hypotension?"
19877,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
19878,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
When a patient presents with hypotension, the important question 
is whether or not the patient is in shock."
19879,"Shock is present if there is 
evidence of multisystem organ hypoperfusion."
19880,"This may manifest 
itself as tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, poorly perfused skin 
and extremities, altered mental status, or decreased urinary output."
19881,"In addition, it is not necessary for a patient to have overt hypoten -
sion to be in shock since a marked reduction in a patient’s usual BP 
may cause shock (but still be in the low-normal range in previously 
hypertensive patients)."
19882,"Given the life-threatening nature of shock, 
hemodynamic stabilization must be prompt and cannot wait for a 
long series of investigations to be completed."
19883,"Therefore, a rational, rapid approach to hypotension is nec -
essary."
19884,"The 3 main etiologies of shock include distributive  (low 
total peripheral resistance, usually septic), cardiogenic  (low cardiac 
output despite adequate intravascular volume), and hypovolemic  
(low cardiac output due to low intravascular volume)."
19885,"In terms of 
epidemiology, septic shock is by far and away the most common."
19886,"In a trial of over 1600 patients with shock, 62% had septic shock, 
16% had hypovolemic shock, and 16% had cardiogenic shock."

with evidence of a high cardiac output (wide pulse pressure, brisk 
capillary refill, warm extremities) without an obvious source of sep -
sis, should be evaluated for unusual causes of systemic inflamma -
tory response syndrome (SIRS) (eg, pancreatitis), occult infections, 
and other causes of distributive shock (liver failure, anaphylaxis, 
adrenal insufficiency)."
19909,"Patients with evidence of a low cardiac out -
put of unclear etiology (narrow pulse pressure, sluggish capillary 
refill, cold extremities) should be evaluated for occult massive hem -
orrhage (eg, intra-abdominal) and less common causes of cardio -
genic shock such as PE and pericardial tamponade."
19910,"Such patients 
should also be evaluated for septic shock."
19911,"An echocardiogram can 
be useful in such patients by revealing unsuspected cardiac etiolo -
gies (eg, pericardial tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation due to

19912,"Finally, it is important to realize that overlapping etiologies 
are common, especially septic and cardiogenic shock."
19913,"Figure 25-1 
illustrates the diagnostic approach to shock."
19914,"Ms. P is clearly hypotensive, (especially given her prior his -
tory of hypertension) and the combination of her hypotension, 
tachycardia, and difficulty staying awake clearly suggest inade -
quate tissue perfusion and shock."

the 3 most common categories of shock: hypovolemic, septic, and 
cardiogenic."

19922,"Her

19924,She has costovertebral angle tenderness.
19925,"Labo -
ratory exam reveals a WBC of 15,000/mcL and her lactate 
was 3 mmol/L."
19926,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
19927,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
19928,Ms. P has several features suggesting septic shock.
19929,"Her urinary 
tract symptoms, fever, and costovertebral angle tenderness point 
to a possible urinary tract infection."
19930,"Her leukocytosis is also sug -
gestive."
19931,"Septic shock is therefore the leading and must not miss 
hypothesis."
19932,"Her episode of vomiting suggests some hypovolemia 
but her hypotension is out of proportion to her 1 episode of eme -
sis."
19933,"Another possible diagnosis would be hypovolemia due to an 
osmotic diuresis from severe diabetic hyperosmolar state."
19934,"Finally, 
given her diabetes mellitus and prior CAD, cardiogenic shock from 
an acute MI needs to be considered."
19935,"Table 25-1 lists the differential 
diagnosis."
19936,"Leading Hypothesis: Septic Shock
T extbook Presentation
Patients with septic shock typically have fever, tachypnea, tachy -
cardia, and hypotension."
19937,"Whereas patients with cardiogenic or 
hemorrhagic shock often have cold extremities, patients with septic 
shock often have warm extremities and bounding pulses after fluid 
resuscitation."
19938,"(Pulses are bounding due to a widened pulse pres -
sure.)"
19939,"Mentation may be impaired and urinary output decreased.PATIENT  1
Ms. P has a past medical history of coronary artery disease

19940,"She complains of weak -

19941,"Her initial vital signs 
demonstrate a pulse of 110 bpm and BP of 85/55 mm Hg."
19942,She is having difficulty staying awake during the interview.
19943,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
and what are the active alternatives?"
19944,"What 
other tests should be ordered?"
19945,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The first step in approaching patients with hypotension and shock 
is recognition."
19946,Is there evidence of decreased perfusion?
19947,"This may 
be manifest by any 1 or more of the following:
A."
19948,"Significantly decreased BP
1."
19949,"Typically systolic BP < 90 mm Hg
2."
19950,"A patient may be in shock with a “normal” BP; comparison 
to prior BPs is necessary."
19951,3.
19952,BP should be measured with a manual cuff.
19953,"BPs measured 
with automatic BP cuffs may be inaccurate at lower BPs, 
especially the pulse pressure."
19954,4.
19955,"The pulse pressure should be calculated: pulse pressure = 
systolic BP – diastolic BP ."
19956,"Wide pulse pressures suggest 
high cardiac output, whereas narrow pulse pressures suggest 
low cardiac output (ie, septic shock vs cardiogenic shock)."
19957,"B. Tachycardia
C. Increased respiratory rate
D. Alteration of mental status
E. Decreased urinary output
F. Increased venous lactate
The first pivotal diagnostic step is to differentiate septic shock 
from cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock."
19958,"Hypovolemic shock 
is often obvious due to a history of hemorrhage or dehydration 
and patients usually have a history of melena, bright red blood 
per rectum, vomiting, diarrhea, or poor oral intake."
19959,"In addition, 
it is typically associated with signs of low cardiac output includ -
ing a narrow pulse pressure, cold extremities, and poor capillary 
refill."
19960,"Anemia or acute kidney injury may be evident on laboratory 
exam."
19961,"Distributive shock is most frequently due to sepsis, which 
is often apparent due to a history of fever, rigors, other infectious 
symptoms (cough, rash, abdominal pain, urinary urgency, or dys -
uria) and signs of high cardiac output (warm extremities, bounding 
pulses, a wide pulse pressure, and brisk capillary refill)."
19962,"However, 
some patients with advanced sepsis have a poor cardiac output."
19963,"Laboratory evidence of sepsis often suggests underlying infection, 
including a leukocytosis, an infiltrate on chest film, pyuria on uri -
nalysis, or diagnostic findings on abdominal CT in patients with 
abdominal pain."
19964,"Finally, patients with cardiogenic shock often have 
a history of CAD or HF or symptoms of acute MI."
19965,"Their physi -
cal exam suggests low cardiac output (poor capillary refill, narrow 
pulse pressure, and cold extremities) and may also reveal evidence 
of high filling pressures (jugular venous distention [JVD] or an S3 
gallop)."
19966,"The physical exam, ECG, and echocardiogram can deter -
mine whether cardiogenic shock is secondary to poor contractility, 
outflow obstruction, an arrhythmia, reduced filling, or backflow 
from valve failure."
19967,"The final pivotal step addresses patients in whom the initial 
evaluation does not delineate a likely etiology of shock."

19990,Cardiac output can be increased or decreased in sepsis.
19991,"(1) The drop in systemic vascular resistance decreases 
afterload, which often results in an increase in CO.
(2) On the other hand, leakage of fluid out of 
intravascular space can decrease venous return and 
thereby decrease CO.
(3) In addition, myocardial function can be reduced 
and also decrease CO.
c. Typically, the initial  hemodynamic response is decreased

The first step in the evaluation is to recognize shock."
20177,"Mr. A’s BP 
is exceptionally low for a 71-year-old man."
20178,"His BP , combined 
with his complaint of weakness and cool extremities, makes shock 
likely."
20179,"The next pivotal diagnostic step is to evaluate the history, 
physical exam, and laboratory data to determine if this is likely 
hypovolemic, septic, or cardiogenic shock."
20180,"There are no signs or 
symptoms of sepsis, nor any history to suggest hypovolemia."
20181,"His 
cool extremities are consistent with a low cardiac output state 
(which is often seen in hypovolemic or cardiogenic shock) and his 
JVD suggests that the low cardiac output is due to cardiogenic, 
not hypovolemic, shock."
20182,"Furthermore, his past medical history 
increases the probability of cardiogenic shock."
20183,"Possible etiologies 
of cardiogenic shock include poor contractility (potentially from 
LV or RV MI or preexistent HF), outflow obstruction (due to, 
for example, aortic stenosis or PE), backflow (from acute aortic 
regurgitation or a regurgitant aortic valve), or reduced filling (from 
tamponade or a stenotic mitral valve)."
20184,"Given the patient’s history, 
you consider MI to be most likely."

Weakness, hypotension, and tachycardia are typically present."
20273,"Other classic findings include an elevated jugular venous pressure 
and muffled heart sounds."
20274,"However, the signs and symptoms asso -
ciated with tamponade are quite nonspecific."
20275,"Disease Highlights
A. Cardiac tamponade
1."
20276,"Results when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, 
compresses the heart, and causes a reduction in cardiac 
filling and therefore cardiac output
2."
20277,"May occur secondary to either a pericardial effusion or 
pericardial hemorrhage
B."
20278,"As the signs and symptoms associated with it are nonspecific, 
diagnosing cardiac tamponade relies on understanding the 
conditions that can lead to pericardial effusion and careful 
assessment."
20279,"C. The incidence of cardiac tamponade and pericardial effusions 
are not well documented, and there is little data regarding how 
often pericardial effusions progress to tamponade."
20280,"However, 
pericardial effusions are not uncommon; therefore, identifying 
clinically significant effusions is of great importance."
20281,1.
20282,"Common etiologies of pericardial effusions that may lead 
to tamponade include
a. Idiopathic pericarditis (20–30%)
b. Malignancy (13–36%)
c. Cardiac procedures (16%)
d. Infection (5–21%)e. Acute MI (8%)
f. Collagen vascular disease (5%)
2."
20283,"Of these, effusions due to infection (bacterial, fungal, 
HIV-associated infections) and neoplasm have the greatest 
incidence of progression to tamponade."
20284,3.
20285,"Cardiac tamponade occurs in up to 1–2% of patients 
following cardiac surgery and invasive cardiology procedures 
and commonly occurs as late as 7 days postoperatively."
20286,4.
20287,"Cardiac tamponade was found in almost 19% of patients 
with a type A aortic dissection."
20288,"These patients had 
significantly higher mortality."
20289,"D. Tamponade has a wide range of presentations depending on 
pericardial fluid volume, accumulation rate, and degree of 
compression."
20290,"It is typically grouped into 2 main types:
1."
20291,"Acute tamponade
a."
20292,"Occurs following traumatic injury, rupture of the 
heart or aorta, or an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic 
procedure."
20293,"b. Presents with cardiogenic shock (cool extremities, 
altered mental status, peripheral cyanosis, and JVD)
2."
20294,"Subacute tamponade
a."
20295,"Occurs in the setting of inflammatory disease or 
malignancy."
20296,b.
20297,"Symptoms often mimic HF (fatigue, dyspnea, chest 
fullness)."
20298,"c. Pericardial effusion may reach as much 2 L before 
tamponade physiology occurs."
20299,"E. Physiology: Tamponade occurs as increasing intrapericardial 
pressure compresses the cardiac chambers."
20300,"The key compo -
nents that determine when tamponade occurs are the rate of 
fluid accumulation relative to pericardial stretch."
20301,1.
20302,"T rue filling pressure of the heart is the transmural pressure, 
which is calculated as follows: intracardiac pressure – 
pericardial pressure."
20303,2.
20304,"Rising pericardial pressure offsets intracardiac pressure at 
some point and leads to competition for the chambers to fill:
a."
20305,"During systole, reduced ventricular volume leads to 
decreased pericardial pressure and atrial filling is preserved."
20306,b.
20307,"During diastole, increased ventricular volume leads to 
increased pericardial pressure, decreased atrial transmural 
pressure and as tamponade approaches, late diastolic 
atrial collapse."
20308,"c. As the pericardial effusion continues to increase and 
pericardial pressure rises, the ventricles compete for 
limited space."
20309,"This stress more easily affects the RV and 
can lead to early diastolic collapse of the RV."
20310,3.
20311,"During inspiration, decreased pleural pressure is transmitted 
to the pericardium and causes increased transmural pressure 
and increased venous return and right heart filling."
20312,"In 
tamponade this RV expansion compresses the LV and results 
in shift of the interventricular septum and decreased 
pulmonary venous return and reduced stroke volume."
20313,4.
20314,"As cardiac output drops, increases in heart rate, 
contractility, and peripheral arterial vasoconstriction defend 
circulation until circulatory collapse occurs."

are tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure and pulsus

(28% and 26%, respectively)."
20324,5.
20325,"Pulsus paradoxus
a."
20326,"Defined as an exaggerated decrease in BP with normal 
inspiration
b."
20327,"The paradox comes from decreased systolic BP despite 
increased venous return during inspiration."
20328,"c. In tamponade, when inspiration increases RV filling, 
the expansion of the RV within the confined pericardial 
space pushes the interventricular septum to the left and 
diminishes left heart filling causing cardiac output and 
BP to drop."
20329,"d. Additionally, inspiratory expansion of the lungs leads to 
pulmonary venous pooling and even further reduced LV 
filling."
20330,"e. When the LV diastolic pressures are elevated as in end-
stage renal disease, cardiac tamponade does not result in 
pulsus paradoxus."
20331,"Making an accurate measurement of pulsus 
paradoxus requires a manual sphygmomanom -
eter, a quiet location, and patience."
20332,B. ECG findings associated with tamponade are insensitive.
20333,"Low 
voltage QRS and electrical alterans have estimated sensitivities 
of 43% and 16–21%, respectively."
20334,"C. Chest radiography: Cardiomegaly on chest film is common 
with a pooled sensitivity of 89%."
20335,"D. When cardiac tamponade is suspected, transthoracic echoc -
ardiography is the primary diagnostic test to confirm the 
diagnosis.E."
20336,"The main findings on the transthoracic echocardiography 
include a pericardial effusion associated with the following:
1."
20337,"Late diastolic collapse of the right atria
2."
20338,"Early to mid diastolic collapse of the RV
3."
20339,"Septal shift toward the left during inspiration and toward 
the right with expiration
4."

vena cava
Treatment
A."
20341,"Once cardiac tamponade is diagnosed, pericardial drainage is 
required unless tamponade is due to aortic dissection or free 
wall rupture."
20342,"B. Symptomatic management may be used if the patient is 
hemodynamically stable or in a “pre-tamponade” state."
20343,"This 
consists primarily of volume resuscitation with isotonic fluids 
and supplemental oxygen until drainage can be performed."
20344,"C. Pericardiocentesis can be accomplished under ultrasound 
guidance at the bedside in the ICU if needed emergently."
20345,"Alternatively, this can be performed under ultrasound or fluo -
roscopic guidance in the catheterization laboratory."
20346,"D. If the effusion is loculated, there is a need for pericardial win -
dow, or if the effusion is due to acute traumatic hemopericar -
dium, surgical pericardiotomy is required."

I have a patient with jaundice or abnormal liver

PATIENT  1
Ms. B is a 56-year-old woman who comes to your office 
because her skin and eyes have been yellow for the past 
2 weeks."
20627,What is the differential diagnosis of jaundice?
20628,How would you frame the differential?
20629,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis of jaundice, or hyperbilirubinemia, is 
often organized pathophysiologically."
20630,"It is helpful to review some 
basic physiology first."
20631,"A. Oxidation of the heme moiety of hemoglobin generates biliv -
erdin, which is metabolized into unconjugated bilirubin, and 
then bound to albumin."
20632,B.
20633,"There are 3 steps in bilirubin metabolism in the liver 
(Figure 26-1):
1."
20634,"Uptake: The unconjugated bilirubin-albumin complex 
reaches the hepatocyte; bilirubin dissociates from albumin 
and then enters the hepatocyte."
20635,2.
20636,"Conjugation: Unconjugated bilirubin and glucuronic acid 
combine to make conjugated bilirubin."
20637,3.
20638,"Excretion: The hepatocyte excretes conjugated bilirubin 
into the bile."
20639,a.
20640,"The rate-limiting step of bilirubin metabolism in the liver
b."
20641,"If excretion is impaired, conjugated bilirubin enters the 
hepatic sinusoids and then the bloodstream."
20642,"C. Conjugated bilirubin in the bile is transported through the biliary 
ducts into the duodenum; it is not reabsorbed by the intestine."
20643,1.
20644,"Can be excreted unchanged in the stool
2."
20645,"Can be converted to urobilinogen by colonic bacteria
a. Urobilinogen can be reabsorbed, entering the portal 
circulation."
20646,b.
20647,Some is taken up by the liver and re-excreted into the bile.
20648,"c. Some bypasses the liver and is excreted by the kidney, 
thus appearing in the urine in small amounts."
20649,"d. Can be converted in the bowel to stercobilin rendering 
the stool brown."
20650,"D. Unconjugated bilirubin is not found in the urine because it is 
bound to albumin and cannot be filtered by the glomeruli.E."
20651,"Conjugated bilirubin is filtered and excreted in the urine when 
there is conjugated hyperbilirubinemia."
20652,"The first pivotal point in the differential diag -
nosis of hyperbilirubinemia is determining 
which kind of bilirubin is elevated."
20653,"Dark, tea-colored urine means the patient has 
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia."
20654,"Light stools, often described as “clay colored,” 
occur when extrahepatic obstruction prevents 
bilirubin from entering the intestine."

Regardless of how you organize this differential, the first step is 
to determine whether the hyperbilirubinemia is primarily uncon -
jugated or conjugated."
20677,"The differential of unconjugated hyper -
bilirubinemia is relatively limited."
20678,"If the hyperbilirubinemia is 
conjugated, the second step is to determine whether there is extra -
hepatic obstruction or intrinsic hepatocellular dysfunction due to 1 
of many possible etiologies."
20679,"Although other liver biochemical tests 
can serve as a guide, it is clear from the way the above differentials 
overlap that these tests are not very specific."

Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. ALD is diagnosed by documenting alcohol excess in the pres -
ence of liver disease."
20776,"B. Biomarkers such as GGT, AST, and ALT are not sensitive or 
specific enough to diagnose ALD; macrocytosis may be seen 
but is also insensitive."
20777,"C. Alcoholic steatosis is diagnosed by seeing fatty infiltration on 
imaging in patients with excessive alcohol consumption."
20778,D. Alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical diagnosis.
20779,1.
20780,"Criteria used in randomized trials of therapy include 
history of excessive alcohol consumption; serum bilirubin 
> 4.5 mg/dL; AST < 500 units/L; ALT < 300 units/L; 
exclusion of acute viral, autoimmune, obstructive, or 
malignant liver disease."
20781,2.
20782,"T ransaminases are elevated but generally < 6–7 times the 
upper limit of normal."
20783,"a. AST:ALT ratio > 2 in 70–80% of patients, with ratios

b."

20786,"GGTP (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) is often elevated, 
and the GGTP/alkaline phosphatase ratio is often > 2.5."

20788,"Imaging (with ultrasonography or CT) is most helpful 
for ruling out other diagnoses; can variably see fatty 
infiltration, hepatomegaly, ascites, or cirrhosis."
20789,5.
20790,"Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis but is not 
always necessary."
20791,"E. Cirrhosis is diagnosed when portal hypertension is present or 
on biopsy (also see Chapter 17, Edema)."
20792,"Treatment
A. Abstinence is the primary treatment for all forms of ALD."
20793,B.
20794,"Although the data are conflicting, current guidelines recom -
mend that patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, defined as 
an mDF score ≥ 32, should be treated with corticosteroids; 
pentoxifylline could be considered in patients intolerant of 
corticosteroids."
20795,"C. Patients with advanced disease or alcoholic hepatitis should 
be assessed for nutritional deficiencies and repleted as 
necessary."

in ALD but rather to exclude alternative diagnoses."

discussed in Chapter 3, Abdominal P ain, ultrasonography 
is the best first test to look for stones in the gallblad -
der, although the sensitivity is less for common bile duct 
stones."
20799,"However, in this patient, pancreatic cancer or other 
malignancies are more likely causes of extrabiliary obstruc -
tion than stones."
20800,"Although an abdominal CT scan is argu -
ably a better first test to exclude these possibilities, an 
ultrasound is often obtained first in clinical practice due to its lower cost and lack of adverse effects."

titis are necessary in all patients with liver disease and are 
especially important in Ms. B because of her history of a 
blood transfusion."

RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The differential diagnosis for fatigue, nausea, and vague abdominal 
pain is broad, but the pivotal findings of scleral icterus and tender 
hepatomegaly point toward a hepatic source."

viral hepatitis; hepatitis C is the second most frequent but is usu -
ally asymptomatic acutely."

alternative diagnosis, and the presentation can mimic that of viral 
hepatitis."

Considering the hepatocellular pattern of Mr. R’s liver test abnor -
malities, the acute onset of his symptoms, and his lack of signs 
of chronic liver disease, the pretest probability for some form of 
viral hepatitis is so high that it is not necessary to consider other 
diagnoses at this point."

suggests hepatitis A, it is generally necessary to test for all 3 of the 
primary hepatitis viruses since the exposure history for both hepa -
titis B and C is often unclear."

atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril."

not smoke and has a glass of wine about twice per month."
21166,"She has no history of blood transfusions or injection drug 
use."
21167,"Her physical exam shows a BP of 125/80 mm Hg, pulse 
of 80 bpm, RR of 16 breaths per minute, weight 230 lbs, 
and height 5 ft 9 in (BMI = 34.0)."
21168,"Pulmonary, cardiac, and 
abdominal exams are all normal."
21169,"She shows you blood test results from a recent health 
fair at work: creatinine, 0.9 mg/dL; HbA1C, 6.8%; LDL, 95 mg/dL; platelet count, 272/mcL; bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; 
AST, 85 units/L; ALT, 92 units/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; and

21171,"No one in her family has had liver disease, but her 
mother has thyroid disease."

21173,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is there a 
must not miss diagnosis?"
21174,"Given this differential 
diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?"
21175,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
In the absence of an obvious nonhepatic cause of liver enzyme ele -
vations, the initial approach is to focus on the hepatic causes."
21176,"The 
prevalence of the liver diseases in the differential diagnosis varies 
widely, depending on the population studied."
21177,"For example, in a 
study of over 19,000 young, healthy military recruits, of whom 
99 had enzyme elevations, only 11 were found to have any liver 
disease (4 had hepatitis B, 4 had hepatitis C, 2 had autoimmune 
hepatitis, 1 had cholelithiasis)."
21178,"A study of 100 blood donors with 
elevated enzymes found that 48% had ALD, 22% had NAFLD, 
and 17% had hepatitis C. In another study, patients with elevated 
enzymes in whom a diagnosis could not be made by history or 
blood tests underwent liver biopsy; NAFLD was found in over 
50% of them."
21179,"Pivotal points in Ms. H’s presentation include that the tran -
saminase abnormalities are mild and probably chronic."
21180,"The key 
findings in the history and physical exam are the patient’s diabe -
tes and elevated body mass index (BMI)."
21181,"NAFLD is extremely 
common in obese, diabetic patients, so Ms. H is at high risk for 
this disease."
21182,"She has no specific risk factors for viral hepatitis, but 
often the exposure history is unclear and these diagnoses cannot 
be ruled out without further testing."
21183,"Her alcohol intake is mini -
mal, but sometimes even small amounts of alcohol can cause liver 
enzyme elevations."
21184,"Additionally, other drug and toxin exposures 
always should be considered."
21185,"Even therapeutic doses of acetamin -
ophen can cause transaminitis; in 1 study, 50% of patients taking 
4 g of acetaminophen daily developed transaminases > 2 times the 
upper limit of normal."
21186,"Mild transaminase elevations are seen in 
0.5–3% of patients taking statins (it is not necessary to stop the 
statin in such cases, and the FDA no longer recommends routine 
testing after obtaining a baseline at the start of therapy)."
21187,"Finally, 
her family history of thyroid disease, presumably autoimmune, 
increases the likelihood of autoimmune hepatitis or hyperthyroid -
ism."

malities and diabetes mellitus."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mrs. K is a 75-year-old woman who complains of a painful 
left knee."
21500,"What is the differential diagnosis of joint 
pain?"
21501,How would you frame the differential?
21502,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The causes of joint pain range from common to rare and from 
bothersome to life-threatening."
21503,"Even the most benign causes of 
joint pain can lead to serious disability."
21504,"The evaluation of a patient 
with joint pain calls for a detailed history and physical exam (often 
focusing on extra-articular findings) and occasionally the analysis 
of joint fluid, serologies, and radiologic tests."
21505,"The differential diagnosis of joint pain can be framed with the 
use of 3 pivotal questions."
21506,"First, is a single joint or are multiple 
joints involved (is the joint pain monoarticular or polyarticular)?"
21507,"If the pain involves just 1 joint, the next question is, is the pain 
monoarticular or extra-articular?"
21508,"Although this distinction may 
seem obvious, abnormalities of periarticular structures can mimic 
articular disease."
21509,"Finally, are the involved joints inflamed or not?"
21510,"Further down the differential, the acuity of the pain may also be 
important."
21511,"Figure 27-1 shows a useful algorithm organized according to 
these pivotal points."
21512,"Because periarticular joint pain is almost 
always monoarticular, the first pivotal point differentiates monoar -
ticular from polyarticular pain."
21513,"Periarticular syndromes are dis -
cussed briefly at the end of the chapter."
21514,"The differential diagnosis below is organized by these 3 pivotal 
points as well."
21515,"When considering both the algorithm and the differ -
ential diagnosis, recognize that all of the monoarticular arthritides 
can present in a polyarticular distribution, and classically polyartic -
ular diseases may occasionally only affect a single joint."
21516,"Thus, this 
organization is useful to organize your thinking but should never 
be used to exclude diagnoses from consideration."

21526,"The pain became intolerable within 
about 6 hours of onset and has been present for 3 days 
now."
21527,She otherwise feels well.
21528,"She reports no fevers, chills, 
dietary changes, or sick contacts."
21529,"On physical exam she is in obvious pain, limping into 
the exam room on a cane."
21530,"Her vital signs are temperature, 
37.0°C; RR, 12 breaths per minute; BP , 110/70 mm Hg; 
pulse, 80 bpm."
21531,"The only abnormality on exam is the left 
knee."

21539,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
21540,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
21541,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The patient’s symptoms and physical exam clearly localize the 
problem to articular rather than periarticular structures as the 
exam reveals an inflamed joint with limited range of motion."
21542,"Considering the pivotal points in this case, we can limit the differ -
ential diagnosis to those diseases that cause acute, monoarticular, 
inflammatory joint pain."
21543,"These include septic arthritis, gout, and 
pseudogout."
21544,"T raumatic injury to the knee such as a meniscal injury 
or intra-articular fracture, although suggested by the history, are 
probably less likely given the mild nature of the injury and the 
inflammation of the joint."
21545,"Salient points of the patient’s presentation are the rapid onset 
of the pain; the mild, antecedent trauma; and the lack of systemic 
symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or weight loss."
21546,"Gout is the leading hypothesis given its high incidence, the 
patient’s age, and the single inflamed joint."
21547,"CPPD (sometimes 
referred to as pseudogout) is common in the knee of elderly 
patients and is high in the differential diagnosis."
21548,"An infectious 
arthritis is probably less likely, given the sudden onset and lack 
of systemic symptoms, but it is a must not miss diagnosis since it 
would be potentially disastrous if left untreated."
21549,Both gonococcal and nongonococcal septic arthritis are possibilities.
21550,"Lyme disease 
can affect multiple joints but most commonly causes a monoartic -
ular arthritis of the knee."

21572,The classic location for gout is the first MTP joint (podagra).

Alternative Diagnosis: Septic Arthritis
T extbook Presentation
Septic arthritis usually presents as subacute joint pain associated 
with low-grade fever and progressive pain and disability."
21740,"Because 
the infection is usually caused by hematogenous spread, a risk 
factor for bacteremia (such as injection drug use) is sometimes 
present."

involved in < 15% of patients."
21748,3.
21749,"Infection is most common in previously abnormal joints, 
such as those affected by OA or RA."
21750,"C. Staphylococcus aureus  is the most common organism followed 
by species of streptococcus."
21751,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
21752,"Clinical findings
1."
21753,Fever is present in most patients.
21754,a.
21755,"One meta-analysis found that 57% of patients with 
septic arthritis had fever."
21756,b.
21757,"Recognize that this means that over 40% of patients 
with septic arthritis are afebrile."
21758,c. Fever > 39.0°C is rare.
21759,2.
21760,"Findings predictive of a septic arthritis causing joint pain 
are recent joint surgery (LR+ 6.9) and the presence of a 
prosthetic knee or hip in the presence of a skin infection 
(LR+ 15.0)."
21761,"Fever cannot distinguish septic arthritis from 
other forms of monoarticular arthritis."
21762,"Patients 
with gout may be febrile while those with 
septic joints may not be."
21763,B.
21764,"Laboratory findings
1."
21765,"WBC > 10,000/mcL is seen in only 50% of patients."
21766,2.
21767,Definitive diagnosis is made by Gram stain and culture.
21768,a.
21769,"The Gram stain of synovial fluid is positive in about 
75% of patients with septic arthritis."
21770,b.
21771,"The Gram stain is most likely to be positive 
when the infecting organism is S aureus;  it is less 
likely to be positive when another organism is the 
infecting agent."
21772,3.
21773,Elevated synovial fluid WBC count is predictive.
21774,"a. Synovial fluid WBC count > 100,000/mcL: LR+ 28; 
LR− 0.71.
b."
21775,Lower WBC cut offs are nondiagnostic.
21776,4.
21777,Joint fluid culture is positive in about 90% of cases.

21779,"Blood (and sputum, when appropriate) should also be 
cultured
a."
21780,"May help identify an organism if one is not isolated 
from the synovium
b."
21781,"About 50% of patients will have positive blood cultures.Because of the potential for septic arthritis 
to cause joint destruction, a single, acutely 
inflamed joint should be assumed infected 
until proved otherwise."
21782,"Treatment
A."
21783,Antibiotic therapy is directed by Gram stain findings.
21784,B. Empiric therapy should cover S aureus.
21785,"C. The affected joint should also be drained, either with a 
needle, arthroscope, or arthrotomy (opening the joint in 
the operating room)."
21786,1.
21787,"Small joints can usually be drained and lavaged with serial 
arthrocentesis."
21788,2.
21789,Large joints usually require surgical drainage.
21790,3.
21791,"The knee is an exception, a large joint that, in many cases 
can be treated with serial arthrocentesis."
21792,"D. Patients who receive treatment within 5 days of symptom 
onset have the best prognosis."

deal of overlap): a classic septic arthritis or a triad of tenosyno -
vitis, dermatitis, and arthralgia."
21801,1.
21802,"The triad presentation reflects a high-grade bacteremia with 
reactive features."
21803,2.

T extbook Presentation
Lyme disease presents in different ways at different stages of the 
disease."
21825,"A classic presentation of the joint symptoms is a patient 
with acute, inflammatory knee pain who has been in an area where 
the disease is endemic."
21826,"There may be a history of a previous tick 
bite, rash, or nonspecific febrile illness."
21827,"Disease Highlights
A. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi,  
transmitted by a number of species of Ixodes  ticks."
21828,B.
21829,"The tick most commonly transmits the disease during its 
nymphal stage."
21830,"C. In the United States, the range of the Ixodes  tick has spread to 
include the entire east coast, the south to as far west as central 
Texas, much of the Midwest (Michigan, Northern Illinois, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota), and the west coast."
21831,"D. The clinical picture varies somewhat between the United States 
and Europe and Asia."
21832,"The presentation in the United States is 
discussed below."
21833,"E. Peak incidence is in June and July, with disease occurring from 
March through October."
21834,"F. T ransmission from a tick that has been discovered and removed 
is very low."
21835,1.
21836,"T ransmission from infected nymphal ticks generally occurs 
only after 36–48 hours of attachment (longer for adult ticks)."
21837,2.
21838,"In 1 study, no erythema migrans developed from any tick 
bite in which the tick was removed in < 72 hours."
21839,G. Lyme disease is generally divided into 3 stages:1.
21840,"Early localized disease
a."
21841,"Skin findings are most common, usually a large area of 
localized erythema."
21842,(1) 80% of patients have an acute rash.
21843,(2) 50% of the rashes occur below the waist.
21844,(3) The mean diameter of the rash is 10 cm.
21845,"(4) About 60% of the rashes are an area of 
homogeneous erythema."
21846,"(5) About 30% of rashes are the more classic target 
lesion."
21847,(6) About 10% of the patients have multiple lesions.
21848,"Only about 30% of patients with Lyme disease 
have the classic target rash on presentation."
21849,b.
21850,"Other symptoms include
(1) Myalgias and arthralgias (59%)
(2) Fever (31%)
(3) Headache (28%)
2."
21851,"Early disseminated disease (weeks to a couple of months 
after the bite) usually involves the central nervous system 
(CNS) and the heart."
21852,"a. CNS disease is more common than cardiac and includes 
headache, facial nerve palsy, lymphocytic meningitis, 
and radiculopathy."
21853,"b. Cardiac disease generally involves conduction 
abnormalities (heart block)."
21854,3.
21855,Joint symptoms predominate late in the disease.
21856,a.
21857,"Occur in about 60% of untreated patients beginning 
about 6 months after infection."
21858,"b. Monoarticular knee arthritis is the most common 
finding."
21859,"c. Intermittent attacks or an oligoarticular arthritis may 
also occur."
21860,"d. A very small proportion of patients go on to have 
a chronic syndrome dominated by subjective 
complaints."
21861,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
21862,"Definitive diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical 
characteristics, exposure history, and antibody titers."
21863,"B. Antibodies are insensitive early in the disease and are thus not 
helpful in the setting of acute infection."
21864,C. Antibodies are nearly 100% sensitive in the setting of arthritis.
21865,"Treatment
A."
21866,"There are multiple antibiotic regimens effective in the treatment 
of localized and disseminated Lyme disease."
21867,"B. Prophylactic treatment with a single dose of doxycycline given 
after a tick bite is effective at preventing Lyme disease but is 
generally not recommended given the low likelihood of being 
infected with Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite, even in 
endemic areas."
21868,"C. T reatment of arthritis caused by Lyme disease consists of 4 weeks 
of oral antibiotics."
21869,"D. Chronic symptoms that develop after appropriate treatment of 
Lyme disease do not respond to intensive antibiotic therapy."

features are the polyarticular and inflammatory nature of the joint 
pain and the chronicity of the symptoms."
21888,"Considering these points, as well as the fact that the patient is a

T extbook Presentation
RA is most commonly seen in middle-aged patients with a symmetric 
polyarthritis manifesting itself with painful, stiff, and swollen hands."
21909,Morning stiffness is often a predominant symptom.
21910,"Swollen and 
tender wrists, MCP , and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are 
usually seen on exam."
21911,"Laboratory evaluation may reveal an anemia 
of inflammation and positive RF and anti-citrullinated protein anti -
body (ACPA, sometimes called anti-CCP)."
21912,"Disease Highlights
A. RA is the paradigm for idiopathic inflammatory arthritides."
21913,B.
21914,"The sine qua non of RA is the presence of an inflammatory 
synovitis, most commonly involving the hands."
21915,"This synovitis 
eventually forms a destructive pannus that injures articular 
and periarticular tissue."
21916,C. RA is common and debilitating.
21917,1.
21918,The prevalence of RA is about 1%.
21919,2.
21920,"As many of 28% of patients stop working within a year 
of diagnosis."
21921,"RA should be considered in any adult with 
a chronic, symmetric polyarthritis."
21922,"D. Common findings in RA are:
1."
21923,"Symmetric arthritis of the hands
2."
21924,"Presence of serum RF and ACPA
3."
21925,"Presence of radiographic changes typical of RA on hand and 
wrist radiographs."

Psoriatic arthritis most commonly presents as joint pain in middle- 
aged patients with a history of psoriasis."
22022,"There are signs and symp -
toms of an inflammatory arthritis often involving the wrists, MCP , 
PIP , and DIP joints."
22023,"Exam of the skin reveals psoriasis and psoriatic 
nail changes."
22024,"Disease Highlights
A. Psoriasis is a very common skin disease that can be complicated 
by arthritis."
22025,B. Psoriatic arthritis is one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies.
22026,1.
22027,"The seronegative spondyloarthropathies are diseases 
characterized by inflammatory axial spine involvement, 
asymmetric peripheral arthritis, enthesopathy, and 
inflammatory eye diseases."
22028,2.
22029,"Patients with these diseases classically have a negative ANA 
and RF , giving the group the “seronegative” moniker."
22030,3.
22031,"Other seronegative spondyloarthropathies are ankylosing 
spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and the arthritis associated 
with inflammatory bowel disease."
22032,"C. The distribution of the arthritis in psoriatic arthritis is variable 
but follows 3 general presentations:
1."
22033,Oligoarthritis often involving large joints and the hands.
22034,"Dactylitis, a swelling of the entire finger causing a “sausage 
digit” secondary to both arthritis and tenosynovitis, is a 
classic finding."
22035,2.
22036,"A polyarthritis similar to RA
3."
22037,"A spinal arthritis
D. Psoriatic arthritis can be indistinguishable from RA, especially 
early in the course of both diseases."
22038,1.
22039,Radiographs of the hands can show erosions.
22040,2.
22041,"About 10% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have a 
positive RF ."
22042,"E. Distinguishing features include:
1."
22043,"Common involvement of DIP joints
2."
22044,"Spine involvement that is uncommon in RA
3."
22045,"Arthritis mutilans, a syndrome in which there is marked 
boney destruction around joints causing “telescoping digits.”
Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
22046,"The most diagnostic feature of psoriatic arthritis is the presence 
of psoriasis."
22047,1.
22048,"Psoriasis precedes the development of arthritis in about 
70% of cases."
22049,2.
22050,"Arthritis and psoriasis begin contemporaneously in about 
15% of patients."
22051,3.
22052,"15% of patients do not have psoriasis (at the time of their 
arthritis diagnosis) although there may be a family history 
of the skin disease."
22053,B.
22054,"A very careful skin exam should be done in all patients in 
whom the diagnosis is suspected."
22055,"C. Nail findings
1."
22056,"Psoriasis can cause recognizable changes in the nails 
(pitted, “oil stained” nails)."
22057,2.
22058,"Nail changes occur in only about 20% of people with psoriasis 
but in about 80% of people with psoriasis and arthritis.3."
22059,"Nail changes are especially common in people with DIP 
arthritis."
22060,"A detailed skin and nail exam is important 
when considering the diagnosis of psoriatic 
arthritis."
22061,"Nail polish should be removed for 
the visit."
22062,"Treatment
The treatment of psoriatic arthritis is similar to the treatment 
of RA."

22065,"Disease Highlights
A. SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease primarily affecting 
women of childbearing age."
22066,B.
22067,Various groups are more prone to disease.
22068,1.
22069,Female:male ratio is about 9:1.
22070,2.
22071,"About 5% of patients report a first-degree relative with the 
disease."
22072,3.
22073,Women of color are most commonly affected.
22074,"C. Almost every organ can be involved, although the joints, skin, 
serosa, and kidneys are most commonly affected."
22075,"D. The pathogenesis of the disease is related to the formation of 
autoantibodies to a number of nuclear antigens."
22076,"The ANA is 
the most common."

i. Hematologic disorder (hemolytic anemia or any cytopenia)
j. Immunologic disorder (anti-ds-DNA, anti-SM, or 
antiphospholipid antibodies)
k. Positive ANA
2."
22088,"The diagnosis of SLE requires the presence of 4 or more of 
these criteria."
22089,3.
22090,"Although the same reservations about using diagnostic 
criteria clinically that were discussed above in the section 
on RA apply here, the SLE criteria are frequently used."
22091,"C. Newer diagnostic criteria have also been developed by the 
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) 
group."
22092,1.
22093,"These criteria, referenced at the end of the chapter, give 
somewhat greater primacy to serologic and pathologic 
evidence of SLE."
22094,2.
22095,"A patient may fulfill the criteria with biopsy-proven 
SLE nephritis and the presence of ANA or anti-ds-DNA 
antibodies."
22096,"D. The test characteristics for the diagnostic criteria are given in 
Table 27-8."
22097,"Also included in this table are the test characteris -
tics for the various individual criteria."
22098,"E. Satisfaction of the ACR criteria or the presence of the anti-Sm 
antibody is highly supportive of the diagnosis of SLE."
22099,"Failure 
to fulfill the SLICC criteria or the absence of ANA argue 
strongly against SLE."

1."
22101,"Measuring autoantibodies in SLE provides important 
diagnostic information."
22102,2.
22103,"ANA and anti-ds-DNA
a. ANA is the most sensitive test for SLE."
22104,It is nonspecific.
22105,b. Anti-ds-DNA and anti-Sm are highly specific.
22106,"They are 
also associated with the presence of lupus nephritis."
22107,"c. ANA does not vary with disease activity while 
anti-ds-DNA does."
22108,A negative ANA essentially rules out SLE.
22109,"A 
positive anti-ds-DNA or anti-Sm essentially 
rules in SLE."
22110,d. Staining patterns are often reported with the ANA.
22111,"(1) These patterns correlate, to some extent, with the 
other specific antibodies discussed below and their 
use has, to a great extent, been supplanted by 
these tests."
22112,"(2) In general, the meanings of the staining patterns are 
as follows:
(a) Homogeneous: Seen in SLE, RA, and drug-
induced lupus
(b) Peripheral: Most specific pattern for SLE
(c) Speckled: Least specific pattern."
22113,"Commonly seen 
with low titer ANAs in people without rheumatic 
disease
(d) Nucleolar: Common in patients with scleroderma 
and Raynaud phenomenon."
22114,3.
22115,"Other serologies are helpful because they tend to be associated 
with various subsets of disease."
22116,"a. Anti-RNP: Associated with Raynaud phenomenon and 
myositis and highly sensitive for mixed connective tissue 
disease."

syndrome and photosensitivity
c. Anti-ribosomal P: Highly specific for SLE

of lupus activity."
22123,"Treatment
A."
22124,"Similar to RA, the treatment of SLE is complicated and the 
purview of the rheumatologist."
22125,B.
22126,"In general, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants 
are the mainstays of therapy."
22127,"C. NSAIDs are generally used for symptomatic relief of inflam -
matory symptoms with careful monitoring because of their 
potential nephrotoxic effects."

PATIENT 3
Ms. T is a 21-year-old woman who comes to see you com -
plaining of rash and joint pain for the past 2 days."
22141,"She 
reports being well until 2 days ago when she awoke with pain 
in both knees and mild pain in both wrists."
22142,"No other joints 
were involved."
22143,"She also noted a nonpruritic rash on her dis -
tal arms and legs."
22144,"She describes the rash as “splotchy.” 
The joint pain has worsened over the last 2 days, and she 
reports that both her knees are swollen."
22145,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
22146,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
22147,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Ms. T has acute onset polyarticular joint symptoms."
22148,"From her 
history of knee swelling, it is likely that she has arthritis rather 
than arthralgia."
22149,"The pivotal points are acute onset and polyar -
ticular involvement."
22150,"Considering these points, and limiting the 
differential diagnosis based on the patient’s demographics and associated symptoms, we are able to come up with a fairly short list 
of probable etiologies."
22151,"Given the acuity of the illness, infectious arthritides need to 
be strongly considered."
22152,Many viral illnesses can cause arthritis.
22153,Parvovirus is probably the most common.
22154,"Bacterial illnesses can 
cause polyarthritis in myriad ways."
22155,"Septic arthritides, discussed 
above, can be polyarticular as can disseminated gonorrhea."
22156,"Bac -
terial endocarditis can cause aseptic polyarthritis and can cause 
arthralgias."
22157,"Acute rheumatic fever classically causes a migratory 
polyarthritis and rash."
22158,"Lyme disease, discussed above, is most com -
monly monoarticular but can present in a polyarticular fashion."
22159,"Reactive arthritis, occurring after enteric or urogenital infections, 
is also a possibility."
22160,"Although less likely, given the acute onset, primary rheuma -
tologic diseases must also be considered."
22161,"In a young woman with 
arthritis and a rash, SLE needs to be included on the differential 
diagnosis."
22162,"As discussed above, rash, arthralgias, and arthritis are 
among the most common presenting symptoms in patients with 
SLE."
22163,"In addition to the acuity of the onset, the lack of other 
organ system involvement would be a little unusual for patients 
with SLE."
22164,"RA would be less likely given the patient’s age; how -
ever, Still disease, a variant of RA, may present acutely in young 
patients."
22165,"Given that the viral arthritides are more common than bacte -
rial ones and, as far as we know, the patient has been previously 
well, viral arthritis is probably more likely than bacterial disease."

for about 2 years."
22339,"The pain is worst in the morning and 
evening."
22340,"In the morning, it is associated with stiffness."
22341,The stiffness lasts about 5 minutes and then improves.
22342,"At the end of the day he routinely feels a dull ache that 
is worse if he has had a very active day."
22343,"He recently noticed 
that he is unable to cross his legs (right over left) without 
discomfort."
22344,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
22345,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
22346,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Mr. L is a middle-aged man with chronic, monoarticular symptoms."
22347,"The time course, single joint involvement and noninflammatory 
nature of the process (we have not heard about warmth, erythema, 
or prolonged morning stiffness) are the pivotal points in this case."
22348,"Reviewing the initial differential diagnosis, the articular process 
that best fits the history is OA, a chronic, noninflammatory, often 
monoarticular arthritis."
22349,"OA is so common in older adults that it 
becomes the diagnosis to disprove in all patients who have pain 
at all consistent with OA."
22350,"The disease most commonly affects the 
fingers, knees, hips, and spine."
22351,"CPPD, as was discussed previously, 
is another chronic degenerative arthritis that could produce similar 
symptoms and should be considered."
22352,"In patients with noninflammatory monoarticular symptoms, 
we also have to consider the specific periarticular symptoms that 
can affect the particular joint."
22353,"When considering the periarticular syndromes that cause 
hip pain, it is important to identify where exactly the patient feels 
the pain."
22354,"Lumbar spine disease with radicular symptoms can cause 
pain in the buttocks or lateral hip."
22355,"T rochanteric bursitis is a com -
mon cause of lateral hip pain."
22356,"Inguinal hernias may cause groin 
pain."
22357,Femoral stress fractures may cause groin or lateral hip pain.
22358,"Although such stress fractures are rare and are most commonly 
seen in young women, they should not be missed."
22359,"Use of bisphos -
phonates or corticosteroids should raise the possibility of other 
causes of hip abnormalities, femoral shaft fractures and osteone -
crosis, respectively."
22360,Table 27-14 lists the differential diagnosis.
22361,“Hip pain” is a nonspecific complaint.
22362,"It is 
important to identify the exact location of the 
pain."
22363,"4
When asked to pinpoint the location of his pain, Mr. L reports 
that he primarily feels it in the groin."
22364,"Rest, ibuprofen, and 
heat all seem to help the pain."

he is in more constant pain, and he has begun to limp on bad 
days."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. T is 77-year-old man with acute kidney injury (AKI)."
22574,What is the differential diagnosis of AKI?
22575,"How 
would you frame the differential?"
22576,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
AKI is a broad clinical syndrome defined by an abrupt decrease in 
kidney function over a period of hours to days, characterized by a 
rise in serum creatinine or a decrease in urinary output."
22577,"The time 
frame of development and persistence of kidney damage defines a 
spectrum that extends to acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic 
kidney disease (CKD)."
22578,"Table 28-1 summarizes the current diag -
nostic criteria and staging for AKI, AKD, and CKD, which may be 
relevant in the evaluation and prognostication of disease."
22579,"The framework for the differential diagnosis of AKI is a com -
bination of anatomic and pathophysiologic, typically divided into 
prerenal, intrarenal, and postrenal causes:
A. Prerenal (due to renal hypoperfusion)
1."
22580,"Intravascular volume depletion
a. Gastrointestinal loss
b. Renal loss: drug-induced or osmotic diuresis (such as from 
hyperglycemia), diabetes insipidus
c. Skin and mucous membrane losses

Although 1 etiology may be more likely than 
the others based on the presentation, the initial 
testing is generally the same for every patient 
with AKI."
22653,"The pivotal point in this patient’s presentation is the hypoten -
sion, due to hypovolemia, sepsis (with pneumonia a likely source),

causes prerenal azotemia, but prolonged hypotension such as his 
may lead to renal ischemia and ATN."
22656,"His history of CKD (base -
line creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL), age, and hypertension increase his 
risk of developing ATN whenever renal blood flow is reduced."

maintain normal renal blood flow and GFR with mean 
arterial pressures (MAPs) as low as 80 mm Hg, via

22678,"As renal arterial pressure decreases, afferent arterioles 
vasodilate due to renal prostaglandins, whereas

effects, thus, maintaining glomerular capillary pressure 
and GFR."

range, endogenous vasoconstrictors increase afferent 
arteriolar resistance, leading to reduced glomerular 
capillary pressure and GFR."

to tubular injury and cell death."

PATIENT 2
Mr. K is an 80-year-old man brought in by his family with 
the chief complaint of worsening malaise, anorexia, and 
confusion for the past 3 days."
22876,"He is generally healthy 
and independent, but over the past 2 months has had 
decreased energy and vague abdominal pain."
22877,"Over the last 
3 days, he has been complaining of pain in his right flank, 
for which he has been taking ibuprofen."
22878,"He has been drinking 
liquids but not eating much."
22879,"His past medical history is 
notable for long-standing hypertension, BPH, and remote 
colorectal cancer."
22880,"He takes losartan, amlodipine, and finas -
teride."
22881,"On physical exam, he is alert but confused."
22882,"His BP 
is 160/80 mm Hg, pulse is 88 bpm, RR is 16 breaths per 
minute, and he is afebrile."
22883,"There is no adenopathy, lungs are 
clear, and cardiac exam is normal."
22884,"Abdominal exam shows 
no masses or tenderness; there is mild right-sided abdom -
inal tenderness with normal bowel sounds."
22885,"His prostate 
is mildly enlarged, without nodules."
22886,"There is no peripheral 
edema."
22887,"Initial laboratory test results include Na, 138 mEq/L; 
K,  4.8 mEq/L; Cl, 100 mEq/L; HCO3, 20 mEq/L; BUN,

1.5 mg/dL."
22888,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
22889,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
22890,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
All 3 etiologies of AKI need to be considered."
22891,"His age, prostatic 
enlargement, and vague complaints of abdominal and flank pain 
are all pivotal points suggesting urinary tract obstruction."
22892,"How -
ever, he also could have prerenal AKI from either NSAID use or 
intravascular volume depletion."
22893,"Furthermore, renal hemodynamics 
are altered by angiotensin receptor blockers which can contribute 
to prerenal AKI."
22894,"He has no history suggesting a specific intrarenal 
cause, although the history of hypertension puts him at increased 
risk."
22895,"Thus, intrarenal causes would be considered only if no post -
renal or prerenal cause could be identified, or if the urinalysis were 
suggestive (granular or cellular casts)."
22896,"Table 28-6 lists the differen -
tial diagnosis.2
Antihypertensive agents are discontinued."
22897,"Mr. K’s urine 
sodium is 20 mEq/L, with a FENa of 1%."
22898,"He is given 1000 mL 
of 0.9% saline intravenously."

tinine is 7.0 mg/dL, and he reports increased lower abdom -
inal and right-sided back pain."
22900,"He has had several episodes 
of dribbling urine since receiving the IV fluids."
22901,"A bladder scan 
shows a postvoid residual of 90 mL."
22902,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"

you need?"

Although the urinary indices are suggestive of prerenal azotemia, 
intravenous fluids and the discontinuation of losartan did not sig -
nificantly change his serum creatinine."
22905,"Moreover, the low postvoid 
residual is not suggestive of urethral obstruction due to prostatic 
enlargement."
22906,"The possibility of urinary tract obstruction above the 
level of the bladder should be considered."
22907,"Leading Hypothesis: Urinary Tract Obstruction
T extbook Presentation
Symptoms vary with site, degree, and rapidity of onset of the 
obstruction."
22908,"Obstruction may cause pain if acute or may be pain -
less if chronic."
22909,"Incontinence and dribbling are common if the 
obstruction is urethral."
22910,"Disease Highlights
A."
22911,"Clinical manifestations
1."
22912,"Upper ureteral or renal pelvic lesions can cause flank pain; 
lower obstruction can cause pelvic pain that sometimes 
radiates to the ipsilateral testicle or labium."
22913,2.
22914,"Obstruction must be bilateral to cause AKI; therefore, 
the most common cause of obstructive AKI is prostatic 
enlargement."
22915,3.
22916,"Urinary output
a. Anuria, if obstruction is complete
(1) Anuria is defined as < 100 mL of urine per day."
22917,"(2) Also seen in shock, vascular lesions, severe ATN, 
or severe GN."
22918,b.
22919,"Output can be normal or increased with partial 
obstruction."
22920,"c. Increased output is due to tubular injury that impairs 
concentrating ability and sodium reabsorption."
22921,"d. Incontinence, dribbling, decreased output, and 
hematuria may be present."
22922,B.
22923,"Obstruction accounts for 17% of cases of outpatient AKI, and 
for 2–5% of cases of inpatient AKI and is more commonly 
seen in men than women."
22924,"C. Obstruction can lead to a type 4 renal tubular acidosis with 
hyperkalemia due to tubular injury."
22925,"D. In patients with normal kidneys, unilateral obstruction often 
is undetected because the unobstructed kidney compensates 
enough to maintain normal kidney function."
22926,"E. Prognosis
1."
22927,"Complete or prolonged partial obstruction can lead to 
interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and irreversible loss 
of kidney function."
22928,a.
22929,"Complete recovery of kidney function occurs if total 
ureteral obstruction is relieved within 7 days; little or 
no recovery occurs if the total obstruction is present for 
12 weeks."
22930,b.
22931,Obstruction is a rare cause of end-stage renal disease.
22932,2.
22933,Prognosis of partial obstruction is unpredictable.
22934,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Urine electrolytes are not very helpful."
22935,B.
22936,"The postvoid residual will be increased (> 100 mL) if the 
obstruction is urethral; the postvoid residual will be normal if 
the obstruction is proximal to the bladder."
22937,"C. Renal ultrasound
1."
22938,The best first test to look for obstruction2.
22939,"Has a sensitivity of 90–98% and specificity of 65–84% for 
detecting urinary tract obstruction
3."
22940,"There are 4 settings in which obstruction can occur without 
dilatation of the complete collecting system, leading to a 
false-negative ultrasound."
22941,a.
22942,"With very early (< 8 hours) obstruction
b."
22943,"When the patient is also volume depleted; sometimes 
repeating an ultrasound after hydration will demonstrate 
the dilatation
c. With retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease), which 
can cause hydronephrosis without ureteral dilatation; the 
hydronephrosis and fibrosis are better seen on CT scan
d. With obstruction so mild that there is no impairment in 
kidney function
D. Noncontrast CT can detect sites of obstruction missed on 
ultrasound and is superior to ultrasonography for determining 
the site of ureteral obstruction."
22944,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
2
A renal ultrasound shows an 11-cm right kidney with 
marked hydronephrosis and ureteral dilation."
22945,"The left kidney 
measured 7 cm with significant cortical atrophy."
22946,"A non -
contrast abdominal CT scan revealed a 5-cm colonic mass 
impinging upon the right ureter."
22947,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis, urinary tract 
obstruction?"
22948,"Have you ruled out the active 
alternatives?"
22949,"Do other tests need to be done 
to exclude the alternative diagnoses?"
22950,"At this point, no additional tests are needed to confirm urinary 
tract obstruction."
22951,"The difference in sizes of the kidneys suggests 
underlying unilateral renal disease."
22952,"In elderly individuals, unilateral 
renal artery stenosis or renal artery embolism (atheroembolism or 
thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation) may lead to 
renal atrophy and is frequently asymptomatic."
22953,"This patient’s kid -
ney function is likely asymmetric."
22954,"Because his small left kidney is 
likely nonfunctional, he developed AKI due to unilateral obstruc -
tion of the right kidney."
22955,"Treatment
A."
22956,Relieve the obstruction immediately.
22957,1.
22958,"Modalities
a. Indwelling urinary catheter for bladder neck obstruction
Remember that indwelling catheters can be 
obstructed by clots."
22959,"b. Suprapubic catheter, if indwelling urinary is not possible
c. Percutaneous nephrostomy tubes for ureteral obstruction
d. Ureteral (JJ) stents for ureteral obstruction, if accessible."
22960,"There is no evidence in the literature of statistically 
significant differences in efficacy between percutaneous 
nephrostomy versus ureteral stenting."

urinary output of 500–1000 mL/hour."
22966,"(1) Mechanisms involved include excretion of retained 
fluid during the period of obstruction, diuresis of 
osmotically active solutes, such as urea, and tubular 
dysfunction leading to inability to reabsorb water 
and sodium."
22967,"(2) May require initial 1:1 replacement of fluid losses

turia (with red cell casts), proteinuria, elevated creatinine, hyper -
tension, and edema."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Ms. N is a 23-year-old woman who comes to see you com -
plaining of a rash."
23209,What is the differential diagnosis of a rash?
23210,How would you frame the differential?
23211,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
In clinical practice, rashes are diagnosed through pattern recogni -
tion (sometimes called system 1 reasoning) probably more than any 
other complaint."
23212,"This is an effective way of making a diagnosis when 
the diagnosis is obvious or when the observer is very experienced."
23213,"The risk with this type of reasoning is that diagnostic hypotheses are 
heavily influenced by recent experience, rare diagnoses tend not to 
be recognized, and physicians often reach premature closure on an 
incorrect diagnosis."
23214,"The differential diagnosis of a rash should be based on the 
morphology of the lesion."
23215,"This can be considered the first pivotal 
point in the differential diagnosis."
23216,"To correctly categorize a lesion’s 
morphology, the physician must first identify the primary lesion, 
the typical element of the eruption."
23217,"This process can be compli -
cated as the primary lesion is often affected by secondary changes 
such as excoriation, erosion, crusting, or coalescence."
23218,"Because 
the differential diagnosis of 1 lesion can be extensive, once the 
morphology of the primary lesion is identified, the next pivotal 
points are determining the global reaction pattern and observing 
the distribution of lesions."
23219,"What follows are some important def -
initions, followed by a differential diagnosis of some of the most 
common reaction patterns."
23220,1.
23221,"Macule: lesion without elevation or depression, < 1 cm
2."
23222,"Patch: lesion without elevation or depression, > 1 cm
3."
23223,"Papule: any solid, elevated “bump” < 1 cm
4."
23224,"Plaque: raised plateau-like lesion of variable size, often a 
confluence of papules
5."
23225,"Nodule: solid lesion with palpable elevation, 1–5 cm
6."
23226,"T umor: solid growth, > 5 cm
7."
23227,"Cyst: encapsulated lesion, filled with soft material
8."
23228,"Vesicle: elevated, fluid-filled blister, < 1 cm
9."
23229,"Bulla: elevated, fluid-filled blister, > 1 cm
10."
23230,"Pustule: elevated, pus-filled blister, any size
11."
23231,"Wheal: inflamed papule or plaque formed by transient 
and superficial local edema12."
23232,"Comedone: a plug of keratinous material and skin oils 
retained in a follicle; open comedone has a black inclusion, 
closed comedone appears flesh-colored or pinkish
Primary lesions are further grouped into reaction patterns."
23233,"Papulosquamous eruptions present with papules and plaques 
associated with superficial scaling."
23234,"Folliculopapular eruptions 
begin as papules arising in a perifollicular distribution."
23235,"Dermal 
reaction patterns result from infiltrative and inflammatory pro -
cesses involving the dermal and subcutaneous tissues."
23236,"Petechia 
and purpura occur when there is leakage of blood products into 
surrounding tissues from inflamed or damaged blood vessels."
23237,Blistering disorders present with vesicles and bullae.

Ms. N complains of frequent “breakouts” on her face for 
the last several years."
23271,"She reports the use of many topical 
over-the-counter agents over the years."
23272,"She complains of 
feeling greasy and the need to “squeeze pus” out of lesions 
on a regular basis."
23273,"On examination, there are many erythematous papules, 
occasional pustules, and open and closed comedones on 
the forehead, cheeks, and chin."
23274,"There is a predominance 
of larger nodules along the jaw line."
23275,"Similar erythematous 
papules involve the upper back and chest."
23276,"There is neither 
significant background erythema nor scaling in the scalp, 
eyebrows, or nasolabial folds."

there a must not miss diagnosis?"
23279,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be

The pivotal clues, in this case, are the morphology of the lesion 
and its distribution."
23280,"This patient has a folliculopapular eruption 
that predominantly affects the face, chest, and upper back."
23281,"Primary 
lesions of inflammatory papules, pustules, and comedones place 
acne at the top of the differential."
23282,"The history is typical for acne: a 
chronic course with intermittent flares."
23283,Other folliculopapular conditions must be considered.
23284,"The lack 
of background erythema and telangiectasias makes a diagnosis of 
rosacea less likely."
23285,"Perioral dermatitis typically presents as mono -
morphic small papules and is closely associated with the use of 
topical corticosteroids and cosmetics."
23286,"The mixture of lesion type, 
with comedones as well as papules and nodules, and the more dif -
fuse distribution makes acne more likely than perioral dermatitis."
23287,"An infectious folliculitis is possible, but the course of the disease 
makes this extremely unlikely (Table 29-1)."

mid-to-late adolescence."
23300,"C. Acne may persist beyond adolescence, especially in women."
23301,"D. Acne is caused by the obstruction of sebaceous follicles on the

1."
23303,"Increased sebum is produced (androgen dependent) and 
accumulates in follicles."
23304,2.
23305,"Desquamation of epithelial cells and keratin into sebum-rich 
follicles causes obstruction."

A clinical diagnosis of acne is most likely."
23353,"Although PCOS might 
be considered based on the older age of the patient and the distri -

Several general etiologic categories need to be considered when pre -
sented with a patient with new-onset blisters or vesicles."
23406,"Blisters can 
be a symptom of infection, autoimmune disease, or a reaction to 
an external stimulus."
23407,"Infectious causes include varicella zoster virus 
(VZV), presenting either as chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles), 
and bullous impetigo."
23408,Both are possible in this patient.
23409,"The pro -
dromal pain and unilateral, dermatomal distribution suggest VZV."
23410,"Bullous impetigo can cause blisters in a young, healthy person, but 
these blisters often begin in intertriginous areas."
23411,"Bullous impetigo 
is most common in children."
23412,"Grouped blisters suggest VZV or 
herpes simplex virus (HSV), whereas other blistering diseases may 
demonstrate large distinct blisters or erosions."

23414,"A his -
tory of exposure should be elicited."

23495,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
Given the patient’s prodromal symptoms and classic dermatomal 
distribution, varicella zoster is the leading diagnosis."
23496,"Because the rash 
was thought to be somewhat atypical, a fresh vesicle was unroofed 
with a scalpel tip and the vesicle fluid was sent for PCR testing."
23497,The diagnosis of varicella zoster is often clinical.
23498,"The distribution 
and clinical appearance of lesions, as well as the associated prodro -
mal symptoms, can make the diagnosis obvious."
23499,"Impetigo, bullous 
arthropod bites, and autoimmune blistering diseases typically 
demonstrate larger distinct blisters or erosions."

syndrome and other drug reactions must always be considered 
when medications are in use."
23501,This patient was taking amoxicillin.
23502,"The clinical appearance of the lesions, their localized distribution, 
and the overall time course of the symptoms are not consistent with 
this eruption, so varicella zoster must still lead the list."

23659,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The appearance of the eruption suggests that this condition is pap -
ulosquamous in morphology, meaning that the eruption is com -
posed primarily of papules and plaques with scale."
23660,"Common causes 
of papulosquamous eruptions are psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, fungal 
infections, and nummular dermatitis."
23661,"The patient’s age, acute onset of the rash, and the pattern of 
small papules and plaques are pivotal points suggesting either gut -
tate psoriasis or pityriasis rosea."
23662,"In addition, the finding of pharyn -
geal injection suggests that there may be an infectious component 
(as is common with guttate psoriasis)."
23663,"The configuration of the 
lesions and the scale can be very helpful in narrowing the differ -
ential diagnosis."
23664,"This patient’s scale is confluent over the surface 
of the lesions, consistent with guttate psoriasis."
23665,"Tinea infections 
typically have scale at the border of the lesions (leading edge with 
advancing scale) and pityriasis rosea has scale at the center of the 
lesion (trailing scale)."
23666,"Nummular dermatitis is usually found on 
the extremities and is associated with significant pruritus, making 
it an unlikely diagnosis in this case."

23842,"D. A careful history, including review of medications, recent 
exposures, and food ingestion, is the most important aspect of 
the evaluation to determine a cause."
23843,"E. Laboratory evaluation is sometimes undertaken in cases of 
chronic urticaria, but studies have shown that relevant results 
are so rarely found without other symptoms that this approach 
is discouraged."

A."
23858,"Description of the lesion: petechiae are red, blue or purple, 
nonblanching, pinpoint spots."
23859,"Purpura are larger (up to 
several centimeters) nonblanching macules, papules, or 
plaques that may or may not be palpable (Figure 29-15)."
23860,B.
23861,"Both purpura and petechiae are, to some degree, nonblanch -
ing (ie, the color cannot be compressed out of the lesion 
by pressure)."
23862,"C. The shape of these lesions is variable, ranging from stellate 
to round or oval or targetoid to retiform (netlike)."

are seen on trauma-prone sites, such as the dorsal hand, 
forearm, lateral thigh, and shin."
23870,3.
23871,"The shape of ecchymoses tends to be geometric 
(rectangular) or linear because they are induced by an 
external force."
23872,4.
23873,"Predisposing factors to ecchymoses include weakening of 
the dermal structure secondary to age, corticosteroid use, 
solar damage, and vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) as well as 
coagulation defects.G."

23885,"The degree to which purpuric lesions are palpable is helpful 
diagnostically."
23886,"a. Nonpalpable hemorrhage in the skin is most 
concerning for thrombocytopenia or abnormal platelet 
function."
23887,"b. Extravasation of blood alone into deep tissue layers can 
produce a nodule (such as occurs with a hematoma)."
23888,"c. Edema associated with the vessel injury (such as in 
cases of inflammatory vasculitis) may cause a palpable 
lesion."
23889,"(1) Palpable purpura can be a sign of serious, 
potentially life-threatening, illness (eg, Rocky 
Mountain spotted fever, acute meningococcemia,

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. W is a 30-year-old man who complains of having a sore 
throat for 3 days."
24148,"What is the differential diagnosis of a sore 
throat?"
24149,How would you frame the differential?
24150,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Sore throat is a common condition seen in outpatient clinical 
practice."
24151,"This chapter focuses on patients who have acute onset of 
sore throat."
24152,"Infectious diseases are the cause of acute sore throat in 
the overwhelming majority of patients."
24153,"Patients with chronic sore 
throat, those who do not have signs of infection, or those who do 
not respond to treatment should be evaluated for noninfectious 
causes of sore throat."
24154,"A useful framework for the differential diagnosis of acute sore 
throat is shown below."
24155,"This framework divides the diagnoses into 
those caused by infection (bacterial and viral) and those caused by 
noninfectious processes."
24156,"Viral respiratory infections are the most 
common cause of infectious pharyngitis with the common cold 
caused by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses accounting for at least 
25% of cases."
24157,"Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is 
the most common cause of acute bacterial pharyngitis, account -
ing for 5–15% of sore throats in adults and 20–30% in children."

centage of cases of sore throat and the associated clinical syndrome."

Clinically, the primary goal when seeing a patient with acute, 
probably infectious sore throat is to identify and treat patients with 
GABHS pharyngitis in order to prevent suppurative (ie, peritonsil -
lar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, otitis media) and nonsuppura -
tive (ie, acute rheumatic fever) complications."
24172,"The secondary goal 
is to diagnose the less common bacterial infections ( F necrophorum, 
N gonorrhoea e) that need to be treated."
24173,"In addition, diagnosing the 
nonbacterial pathogens, such as primary HIV, influenza A and B, 
and mononucleosis is important for both therapeutic and prog -
nostic reasons."
24174,"Pivotal points in the evaluation of these patients, 
therefore, include the presence of unilateral symptoms (suggesting 
abscess formation or fusobacterium infection), the presence of 
exudate (suggestive of GABHS), risk factors for sexually transmit -
ted infections and HIV, or signs and symptoms of influenza or 
mononucleosis."
24175,"1
Mr. W’s symptoms started abruptly 3 days ago when sore 
throat, pain with swallowing, fever, and headaches devel -
oped."
24176,"He denies symptoms of cough, coryza, or rhinorrhea."
24177,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
24178,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
24179,"PRIORITIZING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The pivotal points in Mr. W’s history include his sudden onset 
of sore throat, fever, and headache."
24180,"These symptoms suggest an 
infectious cause of sore throat."

1
Mr. W has 3 points on the modified Centor score (fever, 
exudate, and absence of cough)."
24272,A RADT test is performed.
24273,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold 
for the leading hypothesis?"
24274,"Have you ruled 
out the active alternatives?"
24275,"Do other tests 
need to be done to exclude the alternative 
diagnoses?"
24276,"Given a modified Centor score of 3, the patient’s risk of having 
GABHS is 28–35%."
24277,"In this group of patients, the results of a 
RADT will be very helpful, essentially ruling out or ruling in dis -
ease."
24278,Mr. W has no risk factors for HIV.
24279,"He has no symptoms of 
fatigue, malaise, or cough, making influenza a less likely diagnosis."
24280,"He reports no fatigue or lymphadenopathy and is older than 
the typical patient with mononucleosis, making this diagnosis 
less likely."
24281,"Alternative Diagnosis: Influenza
See discussion in Chapter 10, Cough, Fever, and Respiratory 
Infections."

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mr. M is a 23-year-old medical student who lost conscious -
ness this morning after entering his anatomy lab for the 
first time."
24623,He is quite alarmed (and embarrassed).
24624,"What is the differential diagnosis of transient 
loss of consciousness?"
24625,"How would you frame 
the differential?"
24626,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
T ransient loss of consciousness may be caused by trauma, intox -
ication, seizures, hypoglycemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cere -
brovascular disease (involving the brainstem), or syncope."
24627,"Although 
syncope is often incorrectly assumed to be synonymous with tran -
sient loss of consciousness, syncope actually refers to that subset  of 
patients with transient loss of consciousness due to transient global 
cerebral hypoperfusion , which in turn is virtually always caused 
by transient profound hypotension."
24628,"Therefore, the first pivotal 
step in the evaluation of patients with transient loss of consciousness 
is to distinguish syncope from nonsyncopal causes of transient loss of 
consciousness ."
24629,"Three critical characteristics help distinguish patients 
with syncope: Syncope is (1) abrupt in onset, (2) brief in duration, 
and (3) recovery is complete and spontaneous (Figure 31-1)."
24630,"The 
explanation for this is straightforward; because syncope is due to 
transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, the loss of consciousness is 
abrupt."
24631,"Furthermore, restoration of blood flow must occur quickly 
or the patient would die rather than present with syncope."
24632,"There -
fore, syncope is brief."
24633,"Finally, when blood flow is restored, sponta -
neous recovery occurs promptly."
24634,"Patients with other features (eg, a 
prolonged recovery period) should be evaluated for nonsyncopal 
causes that may masquerade as syncope (eg, seizures, hypoglyce -
mia)."
24635,"A useful question is to ask the patient what is the next thing 
the patient remembers after losing consciousness."
24636,"Any significant 
persistence of confusion beyond a minute or two is critical because 
this would suggest a nonsyncopal etiology of the transient loss of 
consciousness (such as a postictal period from a seizure)."
24637,"The second pivotal step in patients with syncope identifies the 
likely category of their syncope: reflex, orthostatic,  or cardiac syncope  
(Figure 31-2)."
24638,"This narrows the differential diagnosis, since each 
of these categories is associated with specific underlying diseases."
24639,"Importantly, this key step also helps identify patients with car -
diac syncope who are at a substantially increased risk for sudden 
death."
24640,"Sudden death may occur if the underlying cardiac process 
that caused the syncope (arrhythmias or obstruction [eg, aortic 
stenosis]) is prolonged rather than brief.Patients with syncope should be carefully 
evaluated to determine if they have cardiac 
syncope and are at increased risk for sudden 
cardiac death."
24641,"The evaluation of all syncopal  patients must include a thor -
ough history, physical exam, and ECG."
24642,"A detailed history of 
the event is critical and includes a description of the setting 
(prolonged standing, warm environment), prior volume loss 
(vomiting, diarrhea, melena, rectal bleeding), exactly what the 
patient was doing (exerting themselves), and the position they 
were in just prior to their syncopal event (standing, sitting, 
supine)."
24643,"Additionally, patients should be asked about triggers 
(pain, anxiety), prodromal symptoms that proceeded the syn -
cope (nausea, abdominal pain), associated symptoms (chest 
pain, palpitations, shortness of breath), and any signs observed I have a patient with transient loss of 
consciousness."

[HF])."
24673,"The physical exam should check vital signs and orthos -
tatic BPs in addition to a thorough cardiac and neurologic exam."
24674,"Finally, an ECG should be obtained in every syncopal patient 
and examined for signs of arrhythmia, conduction disease, ische -
mia, or structural heart disease.Patients with suspected cardiac syncope should be admitted 
for evaluation (Figure 31-3)."

syncope should be suspected in patients with ECG abnormalities 
(abnormal rhythm, bundle branch block [BBB], ischemic changes 
(new or old), left ventricular hypertrophy [LVH], long QT, or

24678,"It is useful to appreciate that since there are only 3 categories of 
syncope, one should also suspect cardiac syncope in patients whose

Mr. M reports that he was in his usual state of health and 
felt perfectly well prior to entering the anatomy dissection 
room."
24705,"Upon viewing the cadaver, he felt queasy and warm."
24706,He became diaphoretic and collapsed to the floor.
24707,"When he 
regained consciousness, he was very embarrassed but not 
confused."
24708,"The instructor told him that he was unconscious 
for only a few seconds."

what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
24710,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
24711,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As noted previously the first step in the evaluation of patients 
with transient loss of consciousness is to distinguish syncope 
from other causes."
24712,"The abrupt onset, brief duration, and spon -
taneous unaided recovery are entirely consistent with syncope 
(Figure 31-1)."
24713,"The next step in the evaluation of such patients is 
to distinguish cardiac syncope from reflex or orthostatic syncope 
(Figure 31-2)."
24714,"The setting (associated with a strong emotional 
trigger) and associated prodromal symptoms of nausea and 
warmth are classic for vasovagal syncope, which is clearly the 
leading hypothesis."
24715,"However, it is critical to also consider car -
diac syncope, which is potentially life-threatening and is a must 
not miss hypothesis."
24716,"While most causes of cardiac syncope are 
uncommon in young patients, HCM and channelopathies, such 
as the long QT syndrome, can present in children and young 
adults and must be considered."
24717,"Indeed, patients with the long 
QT syndrome may have life-threatening arrhythmias triggered 
by emotional stress."
24718,"Finally, orthostatic syncope is an alternative 
hypothesis that must also be considered."
24719,"Table 31-2 lists the dif -
ferential diagnosis and a careful history, physical exam and review 
of his ECG are required (Figure 31-2)."
24720,"1
Mr. M reports no diarrhea, vomiting, melena or rectal bleed -

24721,"He has no known

24722,"He reports no associated chest pain, palpitations, or dys -
pnea."
24723,There is no family history of sudden cardiac death.

change with standing."
24725,"Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate 
and rhythm without a significant murmur, JVD, S3 gallop, 
crackles or edema."
24726,His ECG is normal.

diagnosis?"
24728,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
24729,"Leading Hypothesis: Reflex Syncope due to 
Vasovagal Syncope
T extbook Presentation
Vasovagal syncope typically occurs in young patients following a 
trigger (prolonged standing with or without an emotional stressor) 
and is preceded by prodromal features (warmth, nausea, diaphore -
sis, sweating, and lightheadedness).Disease Highlights
A."
24730,"Reflex syncope refers to a group of related disorders that 
trigger inappropriate cardiovascular reflexes producing 
hypotension and syncope."
24731,1.
24732,"The predominant reflex may be bradycardia (cardioinhibitory 
type), vasodilatation (vasodepressor type), or both."

with pacemakers a potential option for patients with 
severe, recurrent symptomatic cardioinhibitory  reflex 
syncope."
24735,3.
24736,"Types of reflex syncope include vasovagal (or 
neurocardiogenic syncope), situational syncope, and 
carotid hypersensitivity."
24737,4.
24738,"The triggers vary with the type of reflex syncope:
a. Vasovagal syncope: upright posture with or 
without stress
b. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity: Carotid pressure,

24744,"Prolonged standing causes venous pooling, decreasing 
venous return thereby decreasing left ventricular (LV) 
preload (which may be accentuated by dehydration)."
24745,"b. Superimposed anxiety, pain, or fear triggers a 
sympathetic surge, which augments ventricular 
contraction."
24746,"c. Vigorous contraction coupled with decreased LV 
preload results in a markedly low end-systolic volume, 
which triggers intracardiac mechanoreceptors."
24747,d. The mechanoreceptors trigger the vagal reflex.

Cardiomyopathy (HCM)
T extbook Presentation
HCM may be asymptomatic and discovered due to a family history 
of sudden cardiac death, during the evaluation of an asymptom -

when symptoms occur (syncope, HF , atrial fibrillation, or cardiac 
arrest)."
24807,"Disease Highlights
A."
24808,"The most common cause of cardiovascular death in young 
people and among young athletes
B."
24809,"A variety of mutations in sarcomere constituents 
(eg, myosin) result in myocyte hypertrophy with disarray, 
increased cardiac fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction."
24810,"Over 
1400 mutations (usually autosomal dominant) in 11 genes 
have been reported."
24811,"C. Affects 0.02–0.23% of adults in the general population
D. The hallmark of the disease is LVH in the absence of loading 
conditions (hypertension, aortic stenosis, etc.)"
24812,1.
24813,"LVH may develop in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood."
24814,2.
24815,"LVH can affect any part of the LV, although often 
preferentially affects the ventricular septum, which can 
cause left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO)."

3."
24817,"LVOTO increases the risk of progression to HF , stroke, and 
sudden cardiac death."
24818,"The outflow obstruction can be fixed 
or dynamic."
24819,4.
24820,"The pathophysiology of obstruction is complex and due 
to (1) septal hypertrophy causing narrowing of the LV 
subaortic outflow tract and (2) the subsequent drag pulling 
the mitral valve leaflets of into contact with the outflow 
tract."
24821,"The motion of the mitral valve may also cause mitral 
regurgitation."
24822,5.
24823,Chamber size affects the severity of obstruction.
24824,"A smaller 
chamber size (ie, from hypovolemia) brings the anterior 
leaflet of mitral valve closer to the hypertrophied septum 
and increases obstruction."
24825,"This occurs when preload 
decreases (such as with standing), when afterload decreases 
or when contractility increases."
24826,E. Most patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.
24827,"F. Complications include HF , angina, mitral regurgitation, atrial 
fibrillation, stroke, syncope, and sudden cardiac death."

b."
24843,"Usually secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias 
(which may be triggered by myocardial fibrosis and

24844,"Occasionally due to asystole, heart block, pulseless 
electrical activity or thromboembolism."
24845,"c. Annual risk among all patients with HCM: 1–2%
d. Major  risk factors include the following:
(1) Prior events
(a) Prior cardiac arrest
(b) Spontaneous sustained VT
(2) High-risk clinical factors
(a) Family history of sudden cardiac death in first-
degree relative younger than 40 years (with or 
without HCM) or in first-degree relative of any 
age in whom diagnosis of HCM was established(b) Unexplained syncope (particularly if repetitive, 
exercise-induced, or occurs in children)
(c) Massive LVH (≥ 30 mm)
(3) Other risk factors
(a) Abnormal BP response to exercise (drop 
> 20 mm Hg) in patients 40 years or younger
(b) Nonsustained VT on ambulatory cardiac 
(Holter) monitoring ≥ 3 beats at ≥ 120 bpm
(c) Young age
(d) LVOTO
(e) Increased left atrial size

a."
24848,"Develops in 20% of patients with HCM
b."
24849,"Left atrial enlargement may develop secondary to 
decreased LV compliance or mitral regurgitation 
and creates a substrate for the development of atrial 
fibrillation."
24850,"c. Atrial fibrillation decreases LV filling and worsens the 
outflow tract obstruction."
24851,"d. Atrial fibrillation markedly increases the risk of 
thromboembolism (OR 17.7 compared with patients in 
sinus rhythm)."
24852,6.

in the absence of other conditions known to cause LVH 
(ie, hypertension or aortic stenosis)."
24857,2.
24858,"LVH can occur in any part of the LV and in an array of 
distributions but is often asymmetric in distribution."
24859,3.
24860,"The classic pattern that has specific consequences is marked 
by septal hypertrophy."
24861,"B. Cardiac MRI and transesophageal echocardiography can be 
used when transthoracic echocardiography is suboptimal."
24862,"Late 
enhancement with gadolinium identifies myocardial fibrosis 
and is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac 
death."
24863,"C. Physical exam
1."
24864,"Patients with HCM may have (1) a normal physical exam 
or (2) the systolic murmur caused by LVOTO, a harsh 
systolic murmur at the apex and lower left sternal border 
and/or (3) the murmur of mitral regurgitation due to 
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leading to poor 
valve coaptation and mitral regurgitation
2."
24865,"The classic HCM murmur is caused by LVOTO and 
accentuated by maneuvers that decrease chamber size 
(causing increased  obstruction)."

mutation and many mutations are of uncertain 
significance."

24883,"Testing relatives of patients with HCM can be useful, 
especially when probands have a known pathogenic 
mutation."

reports that he was sitting at home watching television 
when he suddenly lost consciousness without any warn -
ing."
24949,"His wife reports that he was unresponsive for approx -
imately 30 seconds."
24950,"There was no tonic-clonic activity 
or incontinence, and the patient was not confused after 
regaining consciousness."

she took Mr. C’s blood glucose when he passed out and that 
the reading was 120 mg/dL."

ordered?"
24954,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As illustrated in Figure 31-1, the first step in patients with loss of 
consciousness is to determine whether this was due to syncope, or 
some nonsyncopal cause (eg, trauma, intoxication, hypoglycemia, 
or seizure)."
24955,"As discussed previously, 3 questions help make this pivotal distinction: Was the loss of consciousness abrupt in onset, 
brief in duration, and was there spontaneous unaided recovery?"
24956,"Clearly, the story suggests that all 3 were true and he therefore 
suffered from syncope."
24957,"(Although hypoglycemia should be con -
sidered in any patient with treated diabetes, his recovery without 
intervention essentially rules that out, as of course, does the normal 
blood glucose at the time.)"
24958,"The second pivotal step in syncopal 
patients is to determine whether the patient has cardiac, orthos -
tatic, or reflex syncope."
24959,"As illustrated in Figure 31-2, this process 
is driven by a search for risk factors and associated symptoms to 
determine whether the patient is at risk for cardiac syncope, which 
could be life-threatening."
24960,"In particular, patients should be asked 
about a prior history of heart disease or a family history of sudden 
death; syncope occurring during exertion or in the supine or seated 
position ; and any associated chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations."
24961,"2
Mr. C denies any history of exertion prior to his loss of 
consciousness."
24962,"He denies any associated chest pain, pal -
pitations, or dyspnea."

Mr. C has suffered 2 MIs."

24977,"The likelihood of cardiac syncope is increased 
even further because Mr. C’s history and exam are not suggestive 
of the other 2 types of syncope: orthostatic or reflex."
24978,"(Orthostatic 
syncope is unlikely given his seated position, the absence of any 
history of volume loss or bleeding, and more importantly, by the 
lack of postural BP change with standing."
24979,"Reflex syncope [due to 
neurocardiogenic syncope] is also unlikely given the lack of any 
trigger, prodrome and because Mr. C.’s syncope occurred while he 
was sitting.)"
24980,"He should be admitted for evaluation while his his -
tory, physical exam, and ECG are examined for clues that might 
suggest the etiology of his probable cardiac syncope (Table 31-1)."
24981,"Prior to ranking the differential, it is useful to review the syndrome 
of cardiac syncope."
24982,"Leading Hypothesis: Cardiac Syncope
T extbook Presentation
Cardiac syncope refers to syncope secondary to disorders arising 
within the heart."
24983,"Arrhythmias (either tachyarrhythmias or bradyar -
rhythmias) are the most common."
24984,"Less common disorders include 
acute coronary syndromes, obstructive syndromes (aortic stenosis, 
HCM and pulmonary embolism), and rare causes (aortic dissec -
tion and atrial myxoma)."
24985,"Classically, patients with cardiac syncope 
are elderly patients with known heart disease (ie, HF or CAD) who 
experience sudden syncope, which may occur without warning."
24986,Patients may have palpitations.
24987,"Disease Highlights
A. Cardiac syncope is associated with markedly increased mortality 
compared with reflex syncope, orthostatic syncope, or syncope 
of unknown cause."
24988,B.
24989,"Among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, sudden cardiac 
death (presumably arrhythmogenic) accounts for 30% of the 
mortality."
24990,"C. Patients in whom cardiac syncope is suspected should be 
admitted for evaluation."
24991,"D. Although there are a large number of cardiac dysrhythmias, 
only a relative few produce syncope."
24992,"Most supraventricular 
tachyarrhythmias will not cause syncope because the AV 
node limits the ventricular response rate."
24993,"The most common 
arrhythmias associated with syncope include
1."
24994,"Tachycardias
a. VT
b. Supraventricular tachycardias associated with an accessory 
pathway (ie, WPW syndrome) or those associated with a 
very rapid ventricular responses."
24995,2.
24996,"Bradycardias
a. Sinus node dysfunction
(1) Sinus bradycardia (< 35 bpm)(2) Sinus pauses (defined as > 3 seconds or > 2 seconds 
with symptoms)
b. AV heart block (second- or third-degree)

c. Syncope associated with chest pain
d. Syncope during exertion (LR+, 6.5–14)
e. Syncope when supine (LR+, 2.5 –∞) or sitting
Syncope during exertion is unusual but 
worrisome and suggests cardiac syncope."
25000,2.
25001,"Other symptoms may suggest cardiac syncope but are less 
specific (palpitations, syncope of sudden onset, dyspnea 
associated with syncope)."
25002,3.
25003,"A careful consideration of a patient’s associated symptoms, 
physical exam findings, or ECG abnormalities may suggest 
a particular cause of cardiac syncope (see Table 31-1)."
25004,4.
25005,"Cardiac syncope is unlikely in patients without known or 
suspected cardiac disease on the basis of the initial history,

25011,"Certain ECG findings in patients with syncope may 
suggest particular cardiac etiologies (Table 31-1)."
25012,"a. ECG evidence of prior MI or a long QT interval 
increases the likelihood of VT.
b. ECG findings of significant bradycardia, second- or 
third-degree AV block increase the likelihood of syncope 
due to sick sinus syndrome (SSS) or AV block."
25013,"c. Bundle branch block (BBB) on ECG increases the 
likelihood of both AV block and VT.
(1) Mortality in patients with syncope and BBB is 28% 
at 40 months."
25014,32% of the deaths were sudden death.
25015,"(2) The increased mortality is attributed to a combination 
of VT or electromechanical dissociation in patients

1."
25103,"≥ 3 consecutive wide complex (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) beats 
(Figure 31-6) > 100 bpm constitutes a wide complex 
tachycardia ( but not necessarily  VT)
a."
25104,"80–90% of wide complex tachycardias are due to VT
b."
25105,"However, supraventricular tachycardias also occasionally 
have wide QRS complexes (> 0.12 s) due to either 
a concomitant BBB or an accessory pathway, 
hyperkalemia, or drug-induced QRS changes (tricyclic 
antidepressants overdose and class 1a antiarrhythmics)
c. A history of CAD or HF increases the likelihood that 
the wide complex tachycardia is VT.
d. ECG criteria that increase the likelihood that the 
wide complex tachycardia is due to VT rather than 
supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy include:
(1) Capture beats (a narrow supraventricular complex 
present in the midst of the wide complex tachycardia)(2) Fusion beats (a QRS complex with a hybrid 
morphology between that of the normal narrow 
QRS complex and that of the wide complex 
tachycardia)."
25106,"This suggests a supraventricular 
impulse partially captured the ventricle."
25107,"(3) AV dissociation
(4) Concordance of the precordial leads (chest leads 
either entirely all positive or entirely all negative) 
(Figure 31-7)
(5) QRS duration > 160 msec, LR+ 22.9
(6) The absence of these findings does not establish 
supraventricular tachycardia."
25108,e. Review of prior ECGs can be helpful.
25109,"(1) A preexistent BBB on a prior ECG (during sinus 
rhythm) with the same QRS morphology as that 
during the arrhythmia favors supraventricular 
tachycardia with aberrancy."

supraventricular tachycardia with antidromic 
conduction down the accessory tract."

syndrome."
25142,"Briefly, acute coronary syndromes account for approxi -
mately 3% of patients presenting to emergency departments with

cope (particularly in inferior MIs), advanced AV block (particularly 
in anterior MIs) and VT."
25144,"Symptoms are often atypical in syncopal 
patients with acute MI; chest pain is present in only 17%, dyspnea 
in 30%, and a history of CAD in 54%."

troponin elevation on presentation (50%) and ST-segment eleva -
tion (9%)."

As noted previously, the first pivotal step in the evaluation of 
patients with transient loss of consciousness is to determine if the 
loss of consciousness was due to syncope or some nonsyncopal 
cause (Figure 31-1)."
25292,"Furthermore, the cardinal features of syncope 
are an abrupt onset, brief duration, and a spontaneous unaided 
recovered."
25293,"The remarkable feature of Mrs. S’s history is the pro -
longed period of lethargy and confusion that persisted until she 
reached the emergency department."
25294,"This is a pivotal clue  that sug -
gests a nonsyncopal etiology for her loss of consciousness."
25295,"Diag -
nostic considerations include seizure, hypoglycemia, intoxication, 
or another neurologic event (eg, an ischemic event involving the 
posterior circulation or trauma)."
25296,"The patient’s bruised tongue is 
a diagnostic fingerprint that markedly increases the likelihood of 
a seizure."
25297,"Hypoglycemia-induced syncope is usually preceded by 
either confusion or sympathetic stimulation producing tremulous -
ness, nervousness, or diaphoresis and occurs almost exclusively in 
diabetic patients taking insulin, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinedi -
ones."
25298,Table 31-6 lists the differential diagnosis.
25299,"Patients with syncope should be asked, “What 
was the next thing you remember?” Patients 
who do not remember the ambulance ride or 
suffer a period of amnesia following the event 
(> 5 minutes) should be evaluated for seizures."

25382,"Alternative Diagnosis: Cerebrovascular 
Disease & Syncope
Although physicians commonly consider carotid artery obstruction 
in the differential diagnosis of patients with syncope, syncope requires 
transient global  cerebral hypoperfusion and unilateral obstruction of 
the carotid will not result in syncope."
25383,"Therefore, evaluation of the 
anterior circulation is not indicated in the patient with syncope."
25384,"On 
the other hand, obstruction of the posterior circulation may cause 
transient loss of consciousness by causing ischemia in the reticular 
activating system."

vertebrobasilar insufficiency, and basilar artery occlusion."

disorders are almost invariably associated with neurologic signs or 
symptoms and should be considered whenever patients have syncope 
and other symptoms referable to the brainstem (ie, diplopia, vertigo,

morning of admission when increasing left lower quadrant 
abdominal pain developed."
25398,"The pain increased in intensity 
and became quite severe."
25399,"Upon standing, she lost con -
sciousness and collapsed to the floor."
25400,"She recovered quickly 
and was helped to a chair by her husband."
25401,"When she stood 
several minutes later, she briefly lost consciousness again."
25402,"The patient reports that her abdominal pain is much bet -

25403,She has no chest pain or dyspnea.
25404,"Her vital signs are 
BP , 105/60 mm Hg; pulse, 85 bpm; temperature, 37.0°C;

ordered?"
25409,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As noted in Figure 31-1 the first step ascertains whether Mrs. P 
suffered from syncope or some other transient loss of conscious -
ness."
25410,"The history of abrupt onset and rapid recovery without 
intervention strongly suggests syncope."
25411,"The next step considers 
whether this is likely due to reflex syncope, orthostatic syncope, 
or cardiac syncope (Figure 31-2)."
25412,"Several features of Mrs. P’s syn -
cope are noteworthy."
25413,"First, her syncope occurred in association 
with abdominal pain raising the possibility of vasovagal syncope."
25414,"Second, she had 2 episodes of syncope upon standing."
25415,"This piv -
otal clue raises the possibility of orthostatic syncope from either 
dehydration, hemorrhage, medications, or autonomic dysfunction."
25416,"Finally, cardiac syncope should be considered in all patients with 
syncope."
25417,"Fortunately, Mrs. P has no prior history of heart disease 
that would increase the likelihood of cardiac syncope."
25418,"Additionally, 
she has no suggestive symptoms (syncope with chest pain, syncope 
with exertion, syncope while sitting or supine, palpitations, or 
dyspnea), or signs (significant murmur, gallop, or JVD) to suggest 
cardiac syncope."
25419,Her ECG is also normal.
25420,"The combination of the lack of underlying heart disease or suggestive symptoms of cardiac 
syncope, coupled with recurrent syncope immediately after stand -
ing makes orthostatic syncope likely and cardiac syncope unlikely."

BP fell to 60/0, her pulse was 140 bpm, and she lost con -

25434,"Orthostatic measurement of BP and pulse are 
critical."

Orthostatic hypotension usually becomes symptomatic when 
patients stand."

symptoms include near syncope, weakness, visual blurring, weak -
ness, or leg buckling."

A. Orthostatic hypotension occurs in 20% of patients over age 
75 and accounts for 12–30% of patients with syncope."

25446,"Classic orthostatic hypotension occurs within 3 minutes of 
standing."

> 3–10 minutes or develop rapidly, be transient, and difficult 
to detect with standard sphygmomanometry."

25450,"Due to its rapid improvement, this cannot be detected 
without beat-to-beat BP measurements, but patients may 
be symptomatic nonetheless."
25451,3.
25452,"One study documented that 27% of patients with 
orthostatic dizziness but without demonstrable orthostatic 
hypotension had a history of syncope, suggesting that 
many of these patients had transient or intermittent 
orthostatic hypotension that was undetected."

ology."
25529,"Given the profound orthostatic hypotension and the lack

a. TAVR does not require open heart surgery and 
is a reasonable alternative to surgical aortic valve 
replacement for symptomatic patients  with severe aortic 
regurgitation when the surgical risk is intermediate 
to high."
25616,"(1) As the name implies, the major advantage of these 
valves is that they do not require open heart surgery 
but are placed using a catheter, most commonly 
deployed through the femoral artery."
25617,"(2) The longevity of these bioprosthetic TAVR valves is 
not yet clear."
25618,"(3) Perioperative MI, early major bleeding, acute 
kidney injury, and new-onset atrial fibrillation were 
less common with TAVR than surgical aortic valve 
replacement, whereas early vascular complications, 
need for pacemaker implantation, and perivalvular 
leaks were more common with TAVR."
25619,"(4) These valves require dual antiplatelet therapy for 
3–6 months and then lifelong aspirin therapy."
25620,"b. Surgically placed mechanical valves
(1) Have greater durability and a significantly lower 
rate of failure and need for replacement, which is 
particularly important in patients younger than 
age 55
(2) However, they are associated with an increased 
risk of thromboembolism and require lifelong 
anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists."
25621,"(3) Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are not 
recommended."
25622,"(4) In addition  to warfarin, aspirin is recommended at 
75–100 mg/day."
25623,"c. Surgically placed bioprosthetic valves
(1) Require only brief anticoagulation with vitamin K 
antagonists (for the first 3–6 months following 
placement)
(2) However, have a limited longevity and are typically 
reserved for patients over age 65 (whose life 
expectancy makes the need for a second replacement 
unlikely)."
25624,(3) Lifelong aspirin 75–100 mg/day is recommended.
25625,d. Balloon valvotomy is a less commonly used option.
25626,"(1) Can be used as a palliative procedure but is 
associated with a high complication rate (> 10%) 
and provides only temporary relief (6–12 months)
(2) Reserved for palliation in patients with other serious 
(or lethal) comorbidities and as a bridge to TAVR 
or aortic valve replacement in patients who are 
hemodynamically unstable or require urgent major 
noncardiac surgery
E. Vigorous exercise should be discouraged and vasodilators 
(hydralazine, nitroglycerin, and nifedipine) avoided or used 
with caution in patients with moderate to severe aortic 
stenosis."
25627,"Situational Syncope
A variant of reflex syncope, situational syncope occurs during or 
immediately after micturition, defecation, swallowing, or cough -
ing, which increase vagal tone."
25628,"Carotid Sinus Syndrome
T extbook Presentation
Carotid sinus syndrome (CSS) is another variant of reflex syn -
cope."
25629,"Patients typically complain of syncope or falls that may be 
precipitated when pressure is inadvertently applied to the carotid 
(eg, head turning, buttoning collar, shaving, or cervical motion) or 
occur spontaneously."
25630,"Disease Highlights
A. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) represents a syndrome of 
increased carotid sensitivity with resultant hypotension due to 
bradycardia, vasodilation, or both."
25631,B.
25632,Increasingly common in the elderly.
25633,"Accounts for 8–15% of 
syncopal events in patients older than 40 years with syncope 
of unclear etiology."
25634,C. Mean age 77 and unusual in patients younger than 40 years.
25635,"D. 15–56% of affected patients complain of falls but deny 
syncope."
25636,1.
25637,"May be due to retrograde amnesia or alternatively, 
hypotension that is insufficient to maintain an upright 
posture but sufficient to avoid frank loss of consciousness."
25638,2.
25639,"CSS present in 19–27% of patients with unexplained falls 
but 0% in patients with accidental falls."

Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Carotid sinus massage is used in the diagnosis of CSS."
25642,1.
25643,"Carotid sinus massage is applied (unilaterally) for 
5–10 seconds during continuous ECG and BP monitoring."
25644,"Carotid sinus massage needs to be performed on each side 
separated in time by ≥ 1 minute and in both the supine and 
upright position."
25645,2.
25646,"The inhibitory response is unilateral in 81% of patients, 
suggesting the need to evaluate both carotids."
25647,3.
25648,30–50% of patients have findings only when upright.
25649,4.
25650,"Carotid sinus massage has been complicated by transient 
or permanent neurologic symptoms in 0.24%."
25651,"It is 
contraindicated in patients with carotid bruits, known 
carotid stenosis > 70%, recent cerebrovascular accident, 
transient ischemic attack, or MI within the last 3 months."
25652,B. CSH should be distinguished from CSS.
25653,1.
25654,"CSH is defined as a ≥ 3-second pause or decrease in 
systolic BP (≥ 50 mm Hg) accompanying carotid sinus 
massage."
25655,2.
25656,"CSS is diagnosed in patients with a ≥ 3-second pause 
or decrease in systolic BP (≥ 50 mm Hg) accompanying 
carotid sinus massage and syncope of unknown origin, 
compatible with a reflex mechanism."
25657,3.
25658,"Some authors also recommend diagnosing CSS in patients 
with symptoms during carotid sinus massage and an 
absolute systolic BP ≤ 85 mm Hg to increase sensitivity 
(from 93% to 100%)."
25659,4.
25660,"CSH without concurrent syncope is nonspecific and not 
diagnostic as it occurs in 35% of asymptomatic elderly 
patients without prior falls, dizziness, or syncope."
25661,5.
25662,CSS appears to be more specific.
25663,"It affects only 5% of 
elderly patients without prior falls, dizziness, or syncope."
25664,"Additionally, although this elderly population with CSS 
often has other potential  explanations for syncope (74%), 
alternative diagnoses were made in only 8% of patients in 
whom CSS was diagnosed during follow-up."
25665,"C. 47% of patients report symptoms precipitated by looking 
upward."
25666,"Treatment
The American Heart Association and European Society of Car -
diology concluded that pacemakers are reasonable and should be 
considered in syncopal patients with cardioinhibitory CSS with 
documented asystole of ≥ 3 sec with carotid sinus massage in whom they have been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of 
subsequent syncope and falls (from 38% to 9%)."
25667,"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome
T extbook Presentation
WPW syndrome may be asymptomatic or present with palpita -
tions, dyspnea, near syncope, syncope, or sudden death."
25668,"In some 
patients, the diagnosis may only be made after typical ECG find -
ings are discovered on an ECG performed for some other reason."
25669,"Disease Highlights
A."
25670,"A congenital disorder in which an accessory bundle directly 
connects the atria and ventricular muscle bypassing the AV 
node."
25671,B.
25672,"While many patients with the WPW syndrome remain 
asymptomatic, a variety of life-threatening tachyarrhythmias 
may occur:
1."
25673,"In orthodromic  tachycardia, an impulse spreads down the 
rapidly conducting His-Purkinje system and then back up 
the accessory pathway in a retrograde fashion (Figure 31-10) 
to the atria."
25674,"Because the ventricle is activated by the 
His-Purkinje system, the QRS complex is narrow."
25675,2.
25676,"In antidromic  tachycardia, the reentrant loop runs in the 
opposite direction down the accessory pathway."
25677,"Since 
ventricular depolarization starts at the insertion site of the 
accessory pathway (and not via the rapidly conducting 
His-Purkinje system), it depolarizes from cell to cell 
resulting in a wide complex tachycardia."
25678,3.
25679,"Finally, atrial fibrillation or flutter can develop."
25680,"The 
accessory pathway conducts impulses directly into 
the ventricles (bypassing the AV node), allowing very 
rapid ventricular depolarization and putting patients at 
risk for ventricular fibrillation and sudden death."
25681,"C. Syncope in patients with WPW syndrome is associated with a 
greater frequency (25%) of rapid, life-threatening, conduction 
over the accessory pathway."
25682,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A. Baseline ECG abnormalities during normal sinus rhythm may 
reveal a combination of a short PR interval and a delta wave."
25683,1.
25684,"Short PR interval (< 0.12 s)
a."
25685,"In healthy persons, the normal PR interval is produced 
by a built-in delay at the AV node (designed to allow 
atrial emptying prior to ventricular systole)."

25695,"In WPW syndrome, the accessory pathway bypasses the 
AV node and initiates ventricular depolarization without 
such a delay; this results in a shortened PR interval in 
75% of patients (Figure 31-11)."
25696,2.
25697,"Delta wave
a."
25698,"In most patients with WPW syndrome, the accessory 
pathway inserts directly into the ventricular muscle 
(rather than into the specialized His-Purkinje system)."
25699,"b. Ventricular depolarization spreads slowly from cell to 
cell through gap junctions, rather than rapidly through 
the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system."
25700,"c. This results in slow ventricular depolarization and the 
slow initial upstroke of the QRS complex known as the 
delta wave (Figure 31-11)."
25701,"d. Finally, as this ventricular depolarization progresses, the 
AV node is also processing the supraventricular impulse."
25702,"Eventually, the impulse passes through the AV node, 
activates the His-Purkinje system, and causes rapid 
depolarization."
25703,"This results in a narrow terminal  portion 
of the QRS complex."

A."

1."
25706,"Stress tests: In certain patients, the accessory pathways 
cannot conduct at rapid heart rates, reducing the patient’s 
risk of life-threatening arrhythmias."
25707,"This may be apparent 
on stress tests if there is an abrupt loss of the delta wave and 
short PR intervals at rapid heart rates."
25708,2.
25709,"EPS can be useful for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy."
25710,a. EPS can confirm the presence of a bypass tract.b.
25711,"EPS can measure the conduction characteristics of the 
bypass tract to determine if it can sustain rapid life-
threatening arrhythmias."
25712,"c. Radiofrequency ablation can obliterate the bypass tract 
in high-risk patients."
25713,"d. An EPS is typically offered to the following patients:
(1) Symptomatic patients (eg, history of tachycardia, 
syncope, or sudden death)
(2) Patients with structural heart disease who are at a 
higher risk for atrial fibrillation
(3) In selected asymptomatic patients whose stress test 
does not demonstrate loss of preexcitation at rapid 
heart rates

CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 1
Mrs. M is an 85-year-old woman who comes to the office 
concerned about weight loss."
25895,"She is worried that she has 
something serious."
25896,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
unintentional weight loss?"
25897,"How would you 
frame the differential?"
25898,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Significant unintentional weight loss is defined as > 5% loss of usual 
body weight in the last 6–12 months and can be a harbinger of 
serious underlying disease."
25899,"One study documented significantly 
increased mortality in men with unintentional weight loss compared 
with men whose weight was stable or increased (36% vs ≈ 15%)."
25900,"The evaluation of unintentional weight loss is complicated by its 
frequency among older adults; 15–20% of adults over 65 years of 
age may have unintentional weight loss, and the prevalence rises to 
50–60% among nursing home residents."
25901,"Body weight usually peaks 
about age 60 and then decreases gradually thereafter, especially after 
age 70, although the normal changes are small (< 1 lb/year)."
25902,"It should be noted that weight loss in the elderly is often part 
of an overall syndrome of functional decline called frailty, which 
includes weakness, slowness, low level of physical activity, self- 
reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss."
25903,"When present, 
frailty has significant implications for morbidity and mortality in 
the elderly and frail patients have substantially higher morbidity 
and mortality that their age-matched peers."
25904,"There are a large number of diseases that can cause uninten -
tional weight loss, which are best organized by system (see below)."
25905,"The most common causes of unintentional weight loss in pub -
lished studies are cancer (most commonly gastrointestinal [GI] but 
also lung, lymphoma, and other malignancies), ≈ 19–36%; depres -
sion and alcoholism, 16%; nonmalignant GI diseases, 13%; and 
unknown, 22%."
25906,"Endocrine disorders account for 7% of uninten-
tional weight loss."
25907,"Although cancer is the most common cause, 
it is not the cause in most patients."
25908,"Mild cognitive impairment 
and dementia may also cause weight loss due to a combination 
of increased energy expenditure (due to agitation and pacing) and 
decreased caloric intake."
25909,"Four pivotal points are worth remembering when evaluating 
patients with unintentional weight loss (Figure 32-1)."
25910,"First, the 
weight loss should be documented if possible; 25–50% of patients 
that complain of unintentional weight loss have not in fact lost 
weight (and do not need to be evaluated for causes of weight loss)."
25911,Elderly adults often lose muscle mass and simply look like they lost weight.
25912,"Weight loss should be documented by comparing prior 
weights or, if these are unavailable, by finding a significant decrease 
in a patient’s clothing and/or belt size."
25913,"It may also be helpful to 
see corroborating information from family and/or caretakers and 
trying to elicit a specific amount of weight loss from the patient."
25914,"Clinicians should verify the weight loss or 
document significant changes in the patient’s 
clothing or belt size."
25915,The second pivotal step identifies patients with malabsorption.
25916,"Patients should be asked about changes in their bowel movements, 
including diarrhea or large, difficult to flush or malodorous stools."
25917,"Although an uncommon cause of unintentional weight loss, such 
symptoms suggest small bowel or pancreatic disease and direct 
the diagnostic search."
25918,"Additionally, difficulty with defecation or 
changes in stool caliber raises the possibility of colorectal cancer."
25919,"The third pivotal step differentiates weight loss that is due to 
decreased caloric intake from weight loss that is due to increased 
caloric expenditure or malabsorption."
25920,"Most patients lose weight 
due to decreased caloric intake."
25921,"Weight loss associated with normal 
or increased intake suggests substantial catabolism or energy loss 
that may be seen in patients with cancer, severe chronic obstruc -
tive pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, or poorly 
controlled diabetes."
25922,"Fourth and most importantly: a clinician is most likely to be 
successful in identifying the cause of a patient’s unintentional 
weight loss if she identifies the “company it keeps.” Clinicians 
should perform a truly comprehensive history (including a review 
of systems, psychosocial history, and medication history) and per -
form a detailed head to toe physical exam (with special attention 
to the mental status exam) to identify any abnormalities."
25923,"An initial 
baseline laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood 
count (CBC) with differential, urinalysis, renal panel, calcium, 
hepatic panel, fasting glucose, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), ery -
throcyte sedimentation rate (ESR), thyroid-stimulating hormone 
(TSH), HIV test, and chest radiograph."
25924,"Abnormal, or potentially 
abnormal, findings discovered on history, physical exam, or ini -
tial labs are rarely conclusively diagnostic but often provide critical 
clues to the underlying diagnosis and should be thoroughly evalu -
ated."
25925,"Examples of such findings include anemia, which may be due 
to iron deficiency from an unsuspected carcinoma of the colon or 
stomach; an elevated alkaline phosphatase, which may be due to 
metastatic disease to the liver or bones; hematuria, which may be 
due to carcinoma of the kidney or bladder; or a markedly elevated 
ESR, which may be due to multiple myeloma, temporal arteritis, 
subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), or other chronic infection."
25926,"Additionally, recommended preventive health exams should be 
brought up to date (eg, mammogram, Papanicolaou exam with 
human papillomavirus testing, colonoscopy or other appropriate 
colorectal cancer screening, prostate-specific antigen in selected I have a patient with unintentional weight loss."
25927,How do I determine the cause?

Mrs. M reports that she has lost weight over the last

many pounds she has lost."
25995,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
25996,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
25997,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
The patient’s relatively nonspecific history is typical of many 
patients complaining of weight loss."
25998,"Patients report an unspecified 
amount of weight loss that is associated with anorexia."
25999,"The first 
pivotal step in the evaluation is to verify that weight loss has, in 
fact, occurred."
26000,"1
Mrs. M is new to the clinic and prior weights are unavailable."
26001,"While Mrs. M does not know how many pounds she has lost, 
she does report that her clothes are much too loose and 
she has needed to buy pants that are 2 sizes smaller."
26002,"Mrs. M’s change in clothing size suggests true and significant 
weight loss."
26003,"The second pivotal step in evaluating patients with 
documented weight loss determines whether the patient has symp -
toms suggestive of malabsorption, such as diarrhea or floating 
stools."
26004,"1
Mrs. M does reports that she has a bowel movement daily 
or every other day."
26005,"She notes no diarrhea, no floating or dif -
ficult to flush stools, and no change in her bowel habits over 
the last several years."
26006,"Since the history does not suggest diarrhea or malabsorption, 
the third pivotal step in the evaluation of patients with uninten -
tional weight loss differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric 
intake or absorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure."
26007,"Mrs. M.’s initial complaint already clarified that her weight loss 
was due to anorexia and decreased caloric intake."
26008,"The fourth step 
is a comprehensive, system-based approach utilizing a thorough 
history, (including a past medical history, detailed psychosocial 
history, and review of systems), physical exam, basic laboratory 
tests, and completion of her age-appropriate health maintenance 
examinations to search for diagnostic clues.1
Mrs. M’s past medical history is unrevealing, including a 
review in the Electronic Health Record."
26009,"Her psychosocial 
history is also unrevealing."
26010,"She lives with her husband (who 
is in good health), and they have no difficulty obtaining or 
cooking food."
26011,"She has never smoked tobacco and drinks 
alcohol rarely."
26012,The review of systems is negative in detail.
26013,"On physical exam, Mrs. M looks cachectic and fatigued."
26014,Her vital signs are normal.
26015,"HEENT exam reveals no oral 
lesions or adenopathy."
26016,"Lungs are clear to percussion and 
auscultation."
26017,"Cardiac exam reveals a normal rate and reg -
ular rhythm, with a grade II flow systolic murmur along 
the left sternal border without radiation."
26018,"Her abdomen is 
scaphoid, without hepatosplenomegaly or mass."
26019,"FOBT is 
negative."
26020,"Neurologic exam is normal, including a Mini- Mental 
State Exam on which her score is 29/30."
26021,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"
26022,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
26023,"Unfortunately, like many patients with unintentional weight 
loss, Mrs. M has no specific clues to suggest any particular diag -
nosis."
26024,"Given her cachectic appearance (suggesting her weight loss 
is real despite the lack of documentation) and the fact that cancer 
is the most common cause of unintentional weight loss and a 
must not miss hypothesis, it is the leading hypothesis that must 
be evaluated at this point."
26025,"Her tired appearance also raises the 
possibility of depression (which could be either a primary psychi -
atric disorder or a reaction to an underlying medical condition)."
26026,"Finally, nonmalignant GI disease should also be considered, since 
it is also a common cause of unintentional weight loss."
26027,"Hyperthy -
roidism is also on the differential."
26028,"Table 32-1 lists her differential 
diagnosis."
26029,"Leading Hypothesis: Cancer Cachexia
T extbook Presentation
Patients with cancer cachexia often have advanced disease."
26030,"Weight 
loss in cancer may be due to decreased caloric intake (anorexia), 
increased caloric expenditure, or both."
26031,"They may have other symp -
toms specific to their particular malignancy."
26032,"The cancer may have 
been diagnosed before the weight loss or the weight loss may lead 
to the diagnosis."

A."
26034,"Cancer diagnoses account for up to 36% of cases of unexplained 
weight loss."

26036,"The most common malignancies associated with weight loss 
are GI, lung, and lymphoma."

symptoms in patients with lung cancer (comparable to 
cough)."
26038,"It is more frequent than dyspnea, hemoptysis, 
or chest pain."
26039,D. Unintentional weight loss is common in cancer patients.
26040,"At 
the time of diagnosis, 24% of patients with cancer have lost 
weight."
26041,"E. Weight loss increases the risk of immobility, deconditioning, 
and adversely affects immunity."
26042,"The risk of pulmonary 
embolism, pressure injuries (formerly pressure ulcers), and 
pneumonia are increased."

26126,20% have moderate to severe disability.
26127,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."
26128,"The DSM-5  criteria for MDD require 5 of the following 
9 criteria (1 of which is depressed mood or anhedonia) for 
at least 2 weeks:
1."
26129,"Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day
2."
26130,"Anhedonia with “marked diminished interest or pleasure 
in all or almost all activities”
3."
26131,"Significant appetite or weight change (> 5% of body weight 
in 1 month not associated with dieting)

26135,"Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
8."
26136,"Impaired concentration
9."
26137,"Suicidal ideation
B."
26138,"These criteria must be associated with significant distress or 
impaired functioning and not be secondary to substance abuse 
or another medical condition; in addition, there should be no 
prior history of mania (which would be diagnostic of a bipolar 
disorder)."
26139,"C. Minor depression requires 2–4 of the above symptoms, 
including anhedonia or depressed mood for > 2 weeks."
26140,"D. There are multiple validated screening tools for depression, 
including the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), 
the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 
Geriatric Depression Scale."
26141,"E. Severity can be estimated using the Hamilton Rating Depres -
sion Scale."
26142,"Scores of ≤ 18 are classified as mild to moderate, 
19–22 as severe, and ≥ 23 as very severe depression."
26143,"F. The sadness that accompanies major loss (grief), as in 
bereavement, may be difficult to distinguish from MDD and 
the 2 may coexist."
26144,"Profound sadness, anorexia, insomnia, and 
weight loss may occur."
26145,"Features that suggest grief (rather than 
MDD) include:
1."
26146,"The ability to have periods of happiness or pleasure in grief 
that is often absent in MDD."

with depression by 2- to 3-fold (an absolute increase of 
10– 47%)."
26156,"Again, specific validated screening tools allow 
for standardization, and are easily used in primary care 
workflows."

weight loss should include a complete physical 
examination and review of systems to avoid 
premature closure.Treatment
A. Work-up should include a full psychosocial history, including 
degree of functional impairment, history of domestic violence,

26347,"CHIEF COMPLAINT
PATIENT 2
Mr. O is a 55-year-old man who complains of weight loss."
26348,"He 
reports that he has tried for years to lose weight (unsuc -
cessfully) but that recently he has lost more and more 
weight without effort."
26349,"He was initially pleased but recently 
has become concerned."
26350,"He reports that he has lost 
30 pounds in the last 6 months (from 200 lbs to 170 lbs)."
26351,"At this point, what is the leading hypothesis, 
what are the active alternatives, and is 
there a must not miss diagnosis?"
26352,"Given this 
differential diagnosis, what tests should be 
ordered?"
26353,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As noted above, the first pivotal step in the evaluation of unin -
tentional weight loss is to verify the weight loss."
26354,"Mr. O has clearly 
suffered from verifiable significant unintentional weight loss."
26355,"The 
second pivotal step in the evaluation of patients with documented  
weight loss is to determine whether or not the patient is having 
symptoms that suggest malabsorption."
26356,"2
Mr. O reports no diarrhea, large foul-smelling stools, or diffi -
cult to flush stools."
26357,"He reports that he previously moved his 
bowels once a day but lately only once every other day."
26358,"He 
attributes this to his decreased appetite and decreased 
oral intake."
26359,"Since Mr. O’s weight loss is not obviously secondary to mal -
absorption, the focus turns to the third pivotal step, which differ -
entiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or absorption 
from that due to increased caloric expenditure."
26360,"Like many patients 
with weight loss Mr. O clearly notes a decreased oral intake and 
the evaluation focuses on the fourth pivotal step; a comprehensive, 
system-based approach utilizing a thorough history, (including a 
past medical history, detailed psychosocial history, and review of 
systems), physical exam, basic laboratory tests and completion of age-appropriate health maintenance examinations to search for 
diagnostic clues that will guide further evaluation."
26361,"2
Mr. O notes that he has a decreased appetite and feels 
full quickly after starting to eat."
26362,"His past medical history 
is unremarkable as he has been well except for mild osteo -
arthritis of the knee."
26363,"On psychosocial history, he reports 
that he has not felt down, depressed, or hopeless during 
the past month nor has he been bothered by a lack of inter -
est in activities."
26364,"He denies any changes at home and has 
no trouble obtaining food."
26365,"He has never used tobacco and 
drinks 2 beers about once a month."
26366,"On review of systems, there are no fevers, night sweats, 
swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches, headaches, shortness 
of breath, cough, heat intolerance, palpitations or tremu -
lousness."
26367,"There are also no GI symptoms of oral pain, dys -
phagia, odynophagia, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, 
or jaundice."
26368,"His medications include 600 mg of ibuprofen 2–3 times 
a day for mild osteoarthritis of his left knee."
26369,"Physical exam 
reveals a thin but otherwise healthy appearing middle-aged 
man."
26370,Vital signs are normal.
26371,"The remainder of his exam is 
completely normal."
26372,"Laboratory tests, including CBC with differential, 
hepatic panel, renal panel, urinalysis, CRP , ESR, and TSH, are 
normal."
26373,HIV and FOBT are negative.
26374,"A chest radiograph is 
normal without mass or adenopathy."
26375,The cause of Mr. O’s weight loss is not immediately obvious.
26376,"However, his early satiety and NSAID use are clues that suggest 
peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis, or gastric cancer."
26377,"You con -
sider PUD your leading hypothesis."
26378,"Gastric cancer is an alternative 
hypothesis, and colon cancer is a must not miss hypothesis given his 
change in bowel habits."
26379,Table 32-4 lists the differential diagnosis.
26380,"All medications (prescription, over-the-counter 
and traditional/herbal) should be carefully 
scrutinized in patients complaining of unin -
tentional weight loss."
26381,"Some medications cause 
anorexia directly by suppressing appetite, while 
others act through various organ toxicities."

T extbook Presentation
The pain of PUD is classically described as a dull or hunger-like 
pain in the epigastrium that is either exacerbated or improved by 
food intake."
26388,"The pain is often worse on waking and may radiate to 
the back."
26389,Symptomatic periods often last for several weeks.

A."
26392,"250,000 cases per year in the United States
B. Etiology: In the United States, most ulcers are secondary to 
NSAID use, Helicobacter pylori  infection or both."
26393,"The preva -
lence of H pylori  varies widely depending on the region."
26394,1.
26395,"H pylori  infection
a."
26396,"Present in 50% of the world’s population
b. Asymptomatic in the majority of patients
c. Peptic ulcers (in the stomach or duodenum) develop in 
1–10% of infected patients."
26397,"d. H pylori  may also cause atrophic gastritis, intestinal 
metaplasia, and rarely, gastric cancer (0.1–3% of 
infected patients)."
26398,2.
26399,"NSAIDs
a."
26400,"Virtually all NSAIDs increase the risk of PUD, including 
over-the-counter NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin."
26401,"The risk 
is lower with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors."
26402,b.
26403,"Ulcer disease develops in 25% of persons who take 
NSAIDs regularly.c."
26404,"PUD-related bleeding or perforation is present in 2–4% 
of persons who take NSAIDs regularly."
26405,"d. Results in 100,000 NSAID-associated hospitalizations 
in the United States annually, with 7000–10,000 deaths."
26406,"e. Gastric ulcers are 5 times more common than duodenal 
ulcers."
26407,"f. Ulcers are most likely to occur in the first 1–3 months 
of NSAID use."
26408,"g. Risk factors for NSAID-associated PUD include the 
following:
(1) History of prior PUD
(2) Age > 65 years
(3) High-dose NSAID therapy
(4) Concomitant use of aspirin (low or high dose), 
corticosteroids, or anticoagulants."
26409,"(5) Concurrent H pylori  infection
h. NSAIDs may be nonselective, inhibiting both COX-1 
and COX-2, or selective, inhibiting only COX-2."
26410,(1) Selective COX-2 inhibitors have less GI toxicity.
26411,"(2) However, several selective COX-2 inhibitors increase  
the risk of myocardial infarction and several have 
been withdrawn from the market."
26412,"Celecoxib is still 
available."
26413,"(3) Alternate strategies to decrease the risk of NSAID-
related PUD include concurrent use of proton 
pump inhibitors (PPIs) or misoprostol."

26425,(2) 25% of non-NSAID ulcers are asymptomatic.
26426,b.
26427,Pain often reflects nonulcer dyspepsia rather than PUD.
26428,"(1) Less than one-third of patients with epigastric 
discomfort have PUD."
26429,"(2) Among patients undergoing endoscopy, patients 
with nonulcer dyspepsia have more severe and 
numerous symptoms than patients with PUD."
26430,"c. Surprisingly, several clinical predictors are not good 
at discriminating ulcer from nonulcer dyspepsia 
including:
(1) Response to antisecretory therapy
(2) Epigastric tenderness
(3) The quality of the pain

the patient about NSAID use, including both 
over-the-counter and prescription analgesics, 
as well as low-dose aspirin."
26436,3.
26437,"The first sign of PUD may be a life-threatening 
complication (hemorrhage or perforation): > 50% of 
patients with serious to life-threatening complication had 
no prior symptom."

c. PUD is found more often in patients undergoing 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for weight loss 
than for dyspepsia."
26444,"A significant number of patients with 
NSAID-induced ulcers do not experience pain."

invasive and noninvasive testing."
26455,"(1) Noninvasive
(a) Urea breath tests and H pylori  stool antigen are 
preferred in patients not undergoing EGD."
26456,"(b) The stool antigen test is much more widely 
available than the urea breath test and is used 
much more commonly in practice."
26457,"(c) Serology cannot distinguish prior to current 
infection and is not recommended in most 
cases."
26458,"(2) Invasive
(a) Rapid urease test and biopsy with microscopic 
examination are preferred in patients undergoing 
EGD, although this is not commonly indicated 
as a first step in patients < 60 years."
26459,"(b) Recent PPIs (within 2 weeks) or recent 
antibiotics (within 4 weeks) may cause false-
negative urease tests."
26460,"(c) Active bleeding decreases the sensitivity of rapid 
urease tests."
26461,"Patients with bleeding and negative 
rapid urease tests and negative histology should 
undergo urea breath tests several weeks after 
completing PPI therapy."
26462,(3) Test characteristics are shown in Table 32-6.

26464,"Ulcer diagnosis
a. EGD is more sensitive than upper GI series (92% vs 
54%) and is useful to rule out other serious pathology."
26465,b.
26466,"Recent guidelines stratify the approach to EGD by 
patient age
(1) EGD is recommended in patients aged 60 years or 
older with dyspepsia to rule out serious conditions, 
including cancer."
26467,"(2) EGD is not usually recommended in patients 
younger than 60 years with dyspepsia."

dysphagia or persistent vomiting)."

and use of PPIs."
26486,"In addition, gastric ulcers warrant biopsy to 
rule out malignancy."
26487,B.
26488,"Regardless of the cause of the ulcer, and the presence or 
absence of bleeding, PPIs dramatically suppress acid secretion 
and are the mainstay of therapy."
26489,"For patients infected with 
H pylori , PPIs are given during the course of antibiotic 
therapy, longer for larger ulcers (> 1–2 cm) and in patients 
with complications or persistent symptoms."

recommendations are likely to evolve due to changing 
resistance patterns."

26496,"Appropriate tests include the stool antigen or urea 
breath tests."

of NSAID-associated PUD, including minimizing 
the NSAID dose; avoiding concomitant aspirin, 
corticosteroids, and oral anticoagulants when possible; 
using COX-2 selective inhibitors in patients without 
cardiovascular risk; and adding gastric protection with 
PPIs or misoprostol."
26501,"b. PPIs
(1) Very effective
(2) Reduce the ulceration rate in high-risk patients (those 
over 65 years or with prior ulcers) from 17% to 5% 
as well as the rate of GI bleeding (relative risk 0.13)."
26502,"c. Misoprostol
(1) Similar efficacy to PPIs
(2) Requires dosing 4 times daily and is frequently 
associated with diarrhea, limiting its usefulness."
26503,d. H2-receptor antagonists are less effective than PPIs.
26504,"e. COX-2 inhibitors
(1) Reduce the rate of ulcers compared with nonselective 
NSAIDs (relative risk 0.26) but appear less effective 
than PPIs (when combined with nonselective NSAIDs)."
26505,"(2) Increase the risk of cardiovascular events

(3) The gastric protection of COX-2 inhibitors is 
eliminated in patients on concurrent low-dose aspirin."

gastric ulcers include sucralfate and enteric-coated aspirin."
26507,"g. Patients with recent PUD-related bleeding
(1) Continuing NSAIDs (nonselective with a PPI or 
COX-2 selective) results in high complication rates."
26508,"(2) The combined use of PPIs with COX-2 inhibitors

26524,"Many authorities recommend posttreatment follow-up 
endoscopy for patients with documented gastric ulcers to rule out an underlying gastric cancer missed on initial 
endoscopy."

Hispanics, patients over 55 years, and those with a history 
of H pylori  infection without recent NSAID use)."

26528,"Follow-up endoscopy is particularly important in patients 
with gastric ulcers in whom adequate biopsies were not 
obtained during the initial endoscopy."
26529,"MAKING A DIAGNOSIS
Given the absence of pain, Mr. O’s history of NSAID use, the early 
satiety, and weight loss convince  you to order an EGD."

The EGD reveals 2 gastric ulcers 1.5 cm in size."

reveals organisms consistent with H pylori."
26532,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, gastric ulcer?"

other tests need to be done to exclude the 
alternative diagnoses?"

diseases are the cause of unintentional weight 
loss in 28% of patients."

The first pivotal step in evaluating Mr. A’s unintentional weight 
loss is to verify the weight loss."
26554,"This is clearly established by his 
history and a review of his medical records."
26555,"The second step looks 
for symptoms suggestive of malabsorption and although he denies 
frank diarrhea, his large frequent stools raise the possibility of 
GI diseases associated with malabsorption."
26556,"The third pivotal 
step differentiates weight loss due to decreased caloric intake or 
absorption from that due to increased caloric expenditure and 
the fourth (and pivotal) step reviews the history, physical exam, 
and laboratory studies to look for other clues that might suggest 
a diagnosis."
26557,Mr. A’s social history raises several possibilities.
26558,"First, 
you suspect that his drinking is a problem and might be contrib -
uting to his weight loss."
26559,"Alternatively, he may be more depressed 
than he acknowledges or simply adjusting to lifestyle changes 
precipitated by his separation."
26560,"His difficult to flush stools also 
suggests one of a variety of causes of malabsorption."
26561,"Table 32-7 
lists the differential diagnosis."
26562,"3
On further questioning, Mr. A reports that he drinks “two 
or so” alcoholic beverages a night."
26563,"He proudly states that 
he has never missed work due to a hangover and never 
drinks before noon."
26564,"When you ask him how much alcohol he 
uses  when preparing each drink and whether anyone else 
has commented on his drinking, he gets defensive and 
reminds you he is here because he is losing weight."
26565,"Is the clinical information sufficient to make a 
diagnosis?"
26566,"If not, what other information do 
you need?"
26567,"Mr. A’s defensiveness increases your suspicion of an alcohol use 
disorder."
26568,"You wonder how much alcohol consumption is normal, 
what would constitute problem drinking, and how to evaluate him 
more thoroughly for alcohol use disorder."

Stern_ch32_p561-p586.indd   577 17/07/19   4:22 pm578 / CHAPTER 32
his relationships."
26648,"You ask Mr. A the screening question if he has 
had 5 or more drinks on any day in the last year."
26649,"3
Mr. A reports that he probably drinks that much at least 
once a month when he is “partying.”
Mr. A.’s response increases your concern."
26650,"You elect to adminis -
ter the Audit score questionnaire."
26651,"3
Mr. A scores 15 (out of a possible 40)."
26652,"He acknowledges 
that he tried to cut down while he was married, but 
since his separation, he no longer feels that restraint."
26653,"He acknowledges that occasionally he hears funny sto -
ries about himself from these parties that he cannot 
recollect (amnesia)."
26654,"Mr. A also reluctantly reports that 
he received 2 citations for driving while intoxicated 
within the past year."
26655,"He feels mildly guilty about this but 
assures you he knows better than to make that mistake 
again."
26656,"He reiterates that he has never missed work due to 
his drinking but did miss several family events because he 
was “partying.”
Mr. A’s Audit score, marital difficulties, blackouts, tickets for 
driving while intoxicated, missed social events, and continued use 
despite interpersonal difficulties is diagnostic of an alcohol use dis -
order."

Mr. C is a 32-year-old man with occasional wheezing."
27222,"What is the differential diagnosis of 
wheezing?"
27223,"How would you frame the 
differential?"
27224,"CONSTRUCTING A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Wheezing and stridor are symptoms of airflow obstruction caused 
by the vibration of the walls of pathologically narrow airways."
27225,"Wheezing  is a high-pitch musical sound produced primarily dur -
ing expiration by airways of any size."
27226,"Stridor  is a single high-pitch, 
inspiratory sound that is produced by large airways with severe 
narrowing; it may be caused by severe obstruction of any proximal 
airway."
27227,"Stridor is often a sign of impending airway 
obstruction and should be considered an 
emergency."
27228,Distinguishing between wheezing and stridor is essential.
27229,"Typically, patients with either wheezing or stridor describe their 
symptoms simply as wheezing."

function testsis “A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in which 
many cells and cellular elements play a role.” “In susceptible 
individuals, this inflammation causes recurrent episodes of 
wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough, partic -
ularly at night and/or in the early morning."
27279,"These episodes 
are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow 
limitation that is often reversible either spontaneously or with 
treatment.”
B."
27280,"Clinical manifestations
1."
27281,Asthma is recurrent and intermittent.
27282,a.
27283,"Most patients will have periods with no, or only mild, 
symptoms."
27284,b.
27285,"Patients with severe disease will have persistent 
symptoms."
27286,2.
27287,"Asthma usually presents during childhood but presentation 
as an adult is not uncommon."
27288,3.
27289,"Airway function fluctuates in people with asthma more 
widely than in those without the diagnosis."
27290,"a. Airway function is most commonly measured by peak 
expiratory flow (PEF)."
27291,b.
27292,"Values are generally lowest in the morning and highest 
at mid-day."
27293,"c. PEF will vary by more than 20% in asthmatic patients 
over the course of the day."
27294,4.
27295,"Identifying exacerbating factors and timing of symptoms is 
important."
27296,"It aids in the diagnosis of asthma (exacerbating 
factors are stereotypical) and in treatment (if the factors are 
avoidable or reversible)."
27297,a.
27298,"Asthma frequently worsens at night (probably related 
to decreased mucociliary clearance, airway cooling, and 
low levels of endogenous catecholamines)."
27299,b.
27300,"Asthma frequently worsens with exercise (probably 
related to airway cooling and drying)."
27301,"c. Viral infections are a common cause of asthma 
exacerbations."
27302,"d. A long list of airway irritants and occupational agents 
may cause or exacerbate asthma by a number of 
mechanisms:
(1) Cigarette smoke, perfumes, exhaust
(2) Corrosive agents (ammonia)
(3) Pharmacologic agents (organophosphates)
(4) Reflex bronchoconstriction (ozone)
(5) IgE-mediated (latex)
Asthma should be in the differential diagnosis 
of any patient with intermittent respiratory 
symptoms."
27303,"C. Classification: The present classification scheme for asthma 
helps focus attention on the severity of the asthma and 
dovetails nicely with treatment considerations (Table 33-2)."

the patient."

normalized with albuterol."

was using his albuterol inhaler daily to maintain his asthma 
control."

you ruled out the active alternatives?"

other tests need to be done to exclude the

27456,Mr. C’s clinical history is consistent with asthma.
27457,"The history of 
childhood asthma both makes asthma the most likely diagnosis 
and makes his complaint of “wheezing” more reliable."

of wheezing on exam certainly does not exclude the diagnosis of 
asthma."
27459,"He has intermittent symptoms of wheezing, dyspnea, 
and chest tightness."
27460,"The presence of exacerbating factors and the 
results of spirometry further raise the likelihood of asthma as the 
diagnosis.Because asthma is very common and the initial 
treatment is benign, the treatment threshold is 
low."

always appropriate."

sis of asthma."

Mrs. P is a 62-year-old woman who arrives at the emer -

27474,"The symptoms are present both at rest and with exertion 
and have not improved with an albuterol inhaler."
27475,"She reports that she has had these symptoms intermit -
tently for 6 years."
27476,"When the symptoms occur, they generally 
last for hours to a few days."
27477,"She had been diagnosed with 
asthma and took long- and short-acting beta-agonists and 
inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, before coming off all 
medications 1 year ago."
27478,"She stopped her medications out of 
frustration with side effects and perceived lack of efficacy."

tion."

what are the active alternatives, and is there a 
must not miss diagnosis?"
27484,"Given this differential 
diagnosis, what tests should be ordered?"
27485,"RANKING THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
As discussed above, asthma is very common and should be 
considered in anyone with intermittent pulmonary symptoms."
27486,"The lack of symptom improvement with a beta-agonist and 
the discontinuation of an aggressive asthma regimen without ill 
effects both argue against the diagnosis of asthma in this case."
27487,"In addition, the patient’s complaint of hoarseness is atypical in 
asthma."
27488,"(Hoarseness does sometimes occur with asthma if there is 
associated GERD, postnasal drip, or vocal cord myopathy caused 
by inhaled corticosteroids.)"
27489,"Determining whether her symptoms 
are wheezing or stridor will help narrow the diagnosis."
27490,"PVCM is 
a syndrome of episodic adduction of the vocal cords producing 
stridor."
27491,"The lack of response to bronchodilators and associated 
hoarseness are clues to this diagnosis."
27492,"GERD is a very common 
diagnosis (see Chapter 9)."
27493,"It can cause and worsen asthma and can 
cause hoarseness via irritation of the vocal cords."
27494,"It is sometimes

meability increases leading to tissue edema."

The pivotal points in Mr. S’s presentation are the acuity of the ill -

ditions, such as pharyngitis, and rare but serious causes, such as 
epiglottitis and retropharyngeal abscess."

Disease Highlights
A. COPD is defined in the WHO/NHLBI Global Strategy 
for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) as a “disease state 
characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible."
27758,"The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associ -
ated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to 
noxious particles or gases.”
B. COPD should be considered in any patient with a smoking 
history who has pulmonary complaints."
27759,"These complaints can be:
1."
27760,"Mild (smokers’ cough or lingering colds)
2."
27761,"Moderate (chronic cough, sputum production, and 
dyspnea)
3."
27762,"Severe (activity-limiting dyspnea with life-threatening 
exacerbations)
C. COPD can also be seen in patients without a smoking history 
but with significant exposure to secondhand smoke, occu -
pational dust and chemicals and, especially in less developed 
countries, indoor air pollution from cooking stoves."
27763,"D. Because of the wide variation in disease course, it is impossible to 
give an average amount of exposure necessary to cause disease."
27764,1.
27765,"Pulmonary symptoms usually develop after about 10 years 
of exposure."
27766,2.
27767,Airflow obstruction may develop later.
27768,"E. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are currently being used 
less as descriptors of types of COPD."
27769,1.
27770,"Emphysema is a pathologic term not accurately correlating 
with its general clinical usage."
27771,2.
27772,"Chronic bronchitis is the presence of mucus production 
for most days of the month, 3 months of a year, for 
2 successive years."
27773,"This symptom does not suggest the 
airflow obstruction that causes the morbidity in COPD."
27774,3.
27775,"Due to the overlap and lack of specificity of these 2 terms, 
COPD should be used as the diagnostic term."
27776,"F. The GOLD staging system is often used to classify patients 
based on their symptoms and level of risk of exacerbations."
27777,"The system uses symptom severity and exacerbation risk to 
classify COPD."

27779,"Symptoms, based on the Modified Medical Research 
Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale:
a. Grade 0: “I only get breathless with strenuous exercise.”
b. Grade 1: “I get short of breath when hurrying on level 
ground or walking up a slight hill.”
c. Grade 2: “On level ground, I walk slower than people of 
the same age because of breathlessness, or have to stop 
for breath when walking at my own pace.”

high risk for CO2 retention and for requiring mechanical 
ventilation: pH = 7.66 − 0.00919 × PaO2."
27877,"If the calculated 
pH is greater than the patient’s true pH, he or she is at 
high risk for being intubated."
27878,Sensitivity is ∼ 80%.
27879,"If a patient with a COPD exacerbation requires 
oxygen, it should be provided and not withheld 
for fear of causing CO2 retention."

failure does ensue, it is caused by COPD and not 
by the physician who administered the oxygen."

breath sounds, a prolonged expiratory phase, and scant 
expiratory wheezing."
27888,Her chest radiograph is normal.
27889,"Some 
of the results of her PFTs are shown in Table 33-9."
27890,"Have you crossed a diagnostic threshold for 
the leading hypothesis, COPD?"
27891,"Have you ruled 
out the active alternatives?"
27892,"Do other tests 
need to be done to exclude the alternative 
diagnoses?"
27893,"The combination of her smoking history, reported wheezing, 
and wheezing on auscultation indicates airflow obstruction."
27894,"The 
remainder of her history and physical exam support the diagnosis 
of COPD, and the chest radiograph does not argue for another 
diagnosis."

A."
27907,Chronic sputum production is the hallmark of bronchiectasis.
27908,B.
27909,"The disease is caused by the combination of an airway infec -
tion and an inability to clear this infection because of impaired 
immunity or anatomic abnormality (congenital or acquired)."
27910,"Bronchiectasis can be the result of common (viral infection) 
or rare (Kartagener syndrome) diseases."
27911,1.
27912,"Pertussis and tuberculosis were the classic causes of 
bronchiectasis."
27913,2.
27914,"Some of the common causes now are:
a. Postviral, often with lymphadenopathy causing airway 
obstruction
b. Aspergillus fumigatus,  mainly in association with allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
c. Mycobacterium avium  complex infection, usually causing 
middle lobe disease
d. Cystic fibrosis
e. HIV
C. The most common bacteria isolated from the sputum of people 
with bronchiectasis are H influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  
and Streptococcus pneumoniae."

amyloidosis due to the chronic inflammation."
27916,"Evidence-Based Diagnosis
A."

Sarcoidosis
T extbook Presentation
When lung symptoms predominate, a patient in his 20s or 30s 
presents with dyspnea, cough, and/or wheezing."
27947,"The clinical pre -
sentation may be indistinguishable from asthma."
27948,"Because sarcoi -

27953,"It is the result of a 
cell-mediated immune reaction that causes noncaseating gran -
ulomas."
27954,"It is generally thought that, for a patient to develop 
sarcoidosis, he must have a genetic predisposition and then be 
exposed to certain triggering antigens."
